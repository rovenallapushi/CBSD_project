There are different euthanasia laws in each country.Euthanasia is categorized in different ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, or involuntary. Voluntary euthanasia is legal in some countries. Non-voluntary euthanasia (patient's consent unavailable) is illegal in all countries. Involuntary euthanasia (without asking consent or against the patient's will) is also illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder.[6] As of 2006, euthanasia is the most active area of research in contemporary bioethics.[7] In some countries there is a divisive public controversy over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of euthanasia. Passive euthanasia (known as \"pulling the plug\") is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia however is legal or de facto legal in only a handful of countries (e.g. Belgium, Canada, Switzerland) and is limited to specific circumstances and the approval of councilors and doctors or other specialists. In some countries such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, support for active euthanasia is almost non-existent."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "T"}]}

If pot is legal, more people will use it.  As drug policy undergoes big changes, I\u2019ve been watching rates of youth cannabis use with interest. Whether you like the plant or not, as with alcohol, only adults should be allowed to partake of intoxicating substances. But youth cannabis use is near its highest level ever in the United States.  In Portugal, by contrast, youth rates fell from 2002 to 2006, after all drugs were legalized there in 2001. Similarly, a 2011 Brown University-led study of middle and high school students in Rhode Island found no increases in adolescent use after the state legalized medical marijuana in 2006.  As for adult use, the numbers are mixed. A 2011 University of California at Berkeley study, for example, showed a slight increase in adult use with de facto legalization in the Netherlands (though the rate was still lower than in the U.S.). Yet that study and one in 2009 found Dutch rates to be slightly lower than the European average. When the U.S.\u2019 40-year-long war on marijuana ends, the country is not going to turn into a Cheech and Chong movie.

I think with proper education and resources, there should be a decrease in abortions.

Now as for the limitations they are also from an off the wall thought process. I believe in body autonomy to the point of the baby becoming a being that is viable outside of the womb. Let me explain.  If a baby can not survive on its own outside of the womb then it is technically a parasite something isn't alive yet but something feeding off of the mothers nutrients. When a child is viable outside of the womb it can become a living thing and at that point should not be aborted without an extenuating circumstance, such as rape, incest, or risk of loss of life of the mother or the child.  If the baby or the mothers lives are in danger then it is a medical necessity. If the child will not live outside of the womb anyway it is kinder to not have the woman go through that experience just to bury her baby. and if the mother's life is in danger then again because I believe in reincarnation the baby can be reborn with less damage of hurt feelings. (The parents will mourn yes that is going to happen but an unborn child has not touched as many people as an adult has).  The reason I am more lenient for rape an insect is because it may take longer to legally be able to obtain one and to be of the point of sound mind to understand if that is what they want or not."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "T"}]}

It will make the youth of America curious about the affects of cannabis and make them more inclined to try it. Once they feel the \"high\" that marijuana gives them they will want to try other drugs to feel their \"high\" as well. This a dangerous road to follow.
