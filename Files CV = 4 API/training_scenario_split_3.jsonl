God has put life onto this planet not for them to be sacrificed at the hands of medicine and doctors. Women who want to have abortions have put themselves in these positions of their own volition, making the choices they have to get to where they are. It is not the babies who should be punished, but rather the women who forcibly snuff out the life that they have created at the hands of God. What makes it worse is that pro-choice people often don't realize the carelessness that can occur because of the legalization of abortion.

There are different euthanasia laws in each country.Euthanasia is categorized in different ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, or involuntary. Voluntary euthanasia is legal in some countries. Non-voluntary euthanasia (patient's consent unavailable) is illegal in all countries. Involuntary euthanasia (without asking consent or against the patient's will) is also illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder.[6] As of 2006, euthanasia is the most active area of research in contemporary bioethics.[7] In some countries there is a divisive public controversy over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of euthanasia. Passive euthanasia (known as \"pulling the plug\") is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia however is legal or de facto legal in only a handful of countries (e.g. Belgium, Canada, Switzerland) and is limited to specific circumstances and the approval of councilors and doctors or other specialists.

In Portugal, by contrast, youth rates fell from 2002 to 2006, after all drugs were legalized there in 2001. Similarly, a 2011 Brown University-led study of middle and high school students in Rhode Island found no increases in adolescent use after the state legalized medical marijuana in 2006.  As for adult use, the numbers are mixed. A 2011 University of California at Berkeley study, for example, showed a slight increase in adult use with de facto legalization in the Netherlands (though the rate was still lower than in the U.S.). Yet that study and one in 2009 found Dutch rates to be slightly lower than the European average.

There is a fine line between euthanasia and assisted suicide of course, but to be honest my views on the latter are quite similar. On the other hand, from the perspective of a relative or loved one of someone who chooses this way \"out\" - I cannot fathom what it would take for me to accept it. I am the type of person who will rip to shreds for the wellbeing of family and loved ones, and there is no way in hell that I would just give up on someone's life, even if it were akin to a vegetable.

There are so many families looking to adopt that there is no reason not to give a baby a fighting chance! I'm also very much against abortion because some women choose to use this as a form of birth control, having several abortions throughout their lives. I think with proper education and resources, there should be a decrease in abortions. Another thing to consider is that an abortion made in a rash decision may become a serious mistake causing the mother heartache for years if not the rest of her life because of the decision.

Another concern I have regarding euthanasia is what happens if there is a malfunction with the process and it doesn't work? The person would then be forced to suffer in an even worse condition.

Also, unlike alcohol, those who use cannabis are not apt to have angry outbursts or make poor decisions.

However I do think that there should be limitations.  I have a very off the wall thought process on this. I believe in reincarnation so if a child can't be taken care or will not live a good life (born to a mother who can't afford it, a product of incest, a illness that will not allow for quality of life) then it might be the kinder thing to reset the cycle.  Now as for the limitations they are also from an off the wall thought process. I believe in body autonomy to the point of the baby becoming a being that is viable outside of the womb. Let me explain.  If a baby can not survive on its own outside of the womb then it is technically a parasite something isn't alive yet but something feeding off of the mothers nutrients. When a child is viable outside of the womb it can become a living thing and at that point should not be aborted without an extenuating circumstance, such as rape, incest, or risk of loss of life of the mother or the child.  If the baby or the mothers lives are in danger then it is a medical necessity. If the child will not live outside of the womb anyway it is kinder to not have the woman go through that experience just to bury her baby. and if the mother's life is in danger then again because I believe in reincarnation the baby can be reborn with less damage of hurt feelings. (The parents will mourn yes that is going to happen but an unborn child has not touched as many people as an adult has).  The reason I am more lenient for rape an insect is because it may take longer to legally be able to obtain one and to be of the point of sound mind to understand if that is what they want or not."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "T"}]}

How can a country such as the United States that was built on a platform of honor and integrity allow such a foul thing as Gay Marriage to be passed in the court of law? Gay marriage goes against all of the values and virtues of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. A country in which the majority of its citizens are believers in God should not have passed a law allowing gay individuals to wed. The passing of Gay marriage in the United States is the beginning of the country's downward spiral away from God and into the arms of Satan."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "F"}]}

Marijuana is a gateway drug into much more severe narcotics such as cocaine, heroin, and meth. Legalizing cannabis will allow the youth of America to believe that marijuana is just like alcohol and cigarettes. It will make the youth of America curious about the affects of cannabis and make them more inclined to try it. Once they feel the \"high\" that marijuana gives them they will want to try other drugs to feel their \"high\" as well. This a dangerous road to follow. I agree that cannabis should be decriminalized when it comes to handing out sentences in court, but it should not legalized at a recreational level."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "F"}]}
