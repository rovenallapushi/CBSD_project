There is a fine line between euthanasia and assisted suicide of course, but to be honest my views on the latter are quite similar. On the other hand, from the perspective of a relative or loved one of someone who chooses this way \"out\" - I cannot fathom what it would take for me to accept it. I am the type of person who will rip to shreds for the wellbeing of family and loved ones, and there is no way in hell that I would just give up on someone's life, even if it were akin to a vegetable.

My significant other spent much of his childhood in an orphanage, and this has altered his mental stability dramatically when it comes to self-acceptance, trust, and love.
