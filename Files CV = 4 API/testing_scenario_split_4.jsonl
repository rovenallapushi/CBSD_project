I think with proper education and resources, there should be a decrease in abortions.

Now as for the limitations they are also from an off the wall thought process. I believe in body autonomy to the point of the baby becoming a being that is viable outside of the womb. Let me explain.  If a baby can not survive on its own outside of the womb then it is technically a parasite something isn't alive yet but something feeding off of the mothers nutrients. When a child is viable outside of the womb it can become a living thing and at that point should not be aborted without an extenuating circumstance, such as rape, incest, or risk of loss of life of the mother or the child.  If the baby or the mothers lives are in danger then it is a medical necessity. If the child will not live outside of the womb anyway it is kinder to not have the woman go through that experience just to bury her baby. and if the mother's life is in danger then again because I believe in reincarnation the baby can be reborn with less damage of hurt feelings. (The parents will mourn yes that is going to happen but an unborn child has not touched as many people as an adult has).
