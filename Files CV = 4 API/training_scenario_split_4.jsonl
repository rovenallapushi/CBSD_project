It is the equivalent of \"pulling the plug\" on patients in irreversible comas and other vegetative states, and while that is deemed accaptable by society - why shouldn't a patient be able to express their desire to end things in a dignified way? There is a fine line between euthanasia and assisted suicide of course, but to be honest my views on the latter are quite similar. On the other hand, from the perspective of a relative or loved one of someone who chooses this way \"out\" - I cannot fathom what it would take for me to accept it. I am the type of person who will rip to shreds for the wellbeing of family and loved ones, and there is no way in hell that I would just give up on someone's life, even if it were akin to a vegetable.

I can also entertain the argument that a child born to a mother who doesn't want the child or the mother or parents are, for instance, hard drug addicts, I could see why maybe the baby would be better off not having to grow up in that environment, but I still think it's better to give the baby a chance or give it up for adoption. My main issue with abortion is with late-term abortions and the fact that $500 million/year of taxpayer money funds Planned Parenthood and they donate $30 million/year to political candidates and campaigns."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "T"}]}
