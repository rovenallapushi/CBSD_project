I believe that life begins while a baby is still in the womb. The determining factor of whether a human (or any other animal) is alive is if it's heart is beating, when can be seen at just a few weeks gestation, therefore a fetus should be considered a living being. Many of those in support of abortion argue for a woman's right to choose, however, when it comes to abortion and the right to life of an unborn baby, I believe the right to choose lies within the choice to have sexual intercourse and use or not use birth control. After that, the woman must accept the consequence that at any time, sexual intercourse can result in pregnancy. I realize not every woman has a choice in sexual intercourse in the case of rape and sexual assault, however I believe that in those cases, the woman should immediately seek medical attention to prevent pregnancy, as well as report the incident to police."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "T"}]}

It is the equivalent of \"pulling the plug\" on patients in irreversible comas and other vegetative states, and while that is deemed accaptable by society - why shouldn't a patient be able to express their desire to end things in a dignified way? There is a fine line between euthanasia and assisted suicide of course, but to be honest my views on the latter are quite similar. On the other hand, from the perspective of a relative or loved one of someone who chooses this way \"out\" - I cannot fathom what it would take for me to accept it. I am the type of person who will rip to shreds for the wellbeing of family and loved ones, and there is no way in hell that I would just give up on someone's life, even if it were akin to a vegetable.

However I do think that there should be limitations.  I have a very off the wall thought process on this. I believe in reincarnation so if a child can't be taken care or will not live a good life (born to a mother who can't afford it, a product of incest, a illness that will not allow for quality of life) then it might be the kinder thing to reset the cycle.  Now as for the limitations they are also from an off the wall thought process. I believe in body autonomy to the point of the baby becoming a being that is viable outside of the womb. Let me explain.  If a baby can not survive on its own outside of the womb then it is technically a parasite something isn't alive yet but something feeding off of the mothers nutrients. When a child is viable outside of the womb it can become a living thing and at that point should not be aborted without an extenuating circumstance, such as rape, incest, or risk of loss of life of the mother or the child.  If the baby or the mothers lives are in danger then it is a medical necessity. If the child will not live outside of the womb anyway it is kinder to not have the woman go through that experience just to bury her baby. and if the mother's life is in danger then again because I believe in reincarnation the baby can be reborn with less damage of hurt feelings. (The parents will mourn yes that is going to happen but an unborn child has not touched as many people as an adult has).  The reason I am more lenient for rape an insect is because it may take longer to legally be able to obtain one and to be of the point of sound mind to understand if that is what they want or not."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "T"}]}

It will make the youth of America curious about the affects of cannabis and make them more inclined to try it. Once they feel the \"high\" that marijuana gives them they will want to try other drugs to feel their \"high\" as well. This a dangerous road to follow. I agree that cannabis should be decriminalized when it comes to handing out sentences in court, but it should not legalized at a recreational level."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "F"}]}
