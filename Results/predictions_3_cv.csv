0,5,I think it should not be a womans choice whether or not to keep their baby. There are plenty of other options for a woman other than aborting a fetus so they shouldn't get to play God with someone elses life. It is not a form of birth control.,F,Abortion,F
1,5,I think this is awful. Only God can decide when it's time for someone to go. No one else should get to make this decision. I think it is awful to put this option in anyone elses hands besides God. It is not our choice to make this decision.,T,Euthanasia,F
2,5,"I think gay marriage is a great thing. No one is told who to marry so why should it matter if they choose to marry the same sex. Why get married to someone of the opposite sex just so that you're doing it the right way. Who's to say there is a right way? If the person you are about to marry treats you right, it shouldn't matter what sex they are.",T,Gay Marriage,T

15,29,I believe abortion is fine and should remain legal. A woman should have a right to choose. It is her body. Abortion is a viable option for people who are unfit financially or otherwise to support a child.,F,Abortion,T
16,29,"I think euthanasia is fine. There are multiple layers to this controversial topic but I believe if the nearest of kin gives the ok, it is fine with me.

If there is no chance for a quality of life, I believe euthanasia is ok.",T,Euthanasia,T

18,29,"I believe migrants that are here illegally should be deported. Our society is built on the rule of law. If we have a law and don't enforce it, it makes no sense to have the law. Every other aspect of our society has laws and are enforced. I don't see why laws pertaining to migrants should be any different.",F,Migration,T
19,29,"I believe cannabis should be legalized. We have wasted resources and time that could be better spent in other areas. Plus, prison sentences seem to disproportionately affect minorities and clog our overcrowded prisons.

20,33,"I think abortion should be allowed for everyone. It's their body and they should be able to choose what they want to do with it. Fetuses aren't complete ""human"" yet so it shouldn't be seen as murder.",F,Abortion,F
21,33,"I would never personally do it, but if someone chooses to end their own life, they should have the right to do so.

Better to do it under supervision than by themselves.",T,Euthanasia,T
22,33,"I feel that gay marriage should be allowed as long as it's not marriage in a Christian sense. This means that they should be allowed to legally marry (under law). However, to force the Church to recognize that it is marriage under God's design is what I don't agree with.",T,Gay Marriage,T
23,33,Those that weren't born here should not have the right to stay in a country they illegally came to. It's not safe for citizens and the country's security. To ignore this issue is to put the country and those who live in it at risk.,F,Migration,F
24,33,"I do not know too much about cannabis, but if study shows that it is not as dangerous as it's said to be, I think it's fine.

30,42,Every child has a right to life. One's life starts at conception. Killing a fetus is murder. Expecting mothers considering abortion should go to a clinic and listen to their child's heartbeat. Only a heartless person would end their baby's life after that experience.,F,Abortion,F
31,42,"While I'm conflicted about it, I think it's alright. People have the right to choose to end their lives; it's not my call to judge. No one should be able to force someone to live when no one asked to be born. This is especially true for terminal illnesses that worsen with age. Often, it can be humane.",T,Euthanasia,T
32,42,"I support it and think it should be legal everywhere. I consider myself LGBT, so I have a personal investment. The institution of marriage is flawed anyway, and didn't originally start as a religious practice, so I don't like the argument that it should be ""kept sacred."" Same-sex couples still need the benefits of marriage like tax benefits and family visitation rights, and not allowing them to marry is discrimination.",T,Gay Marriage,T

34,42,"Keeping cannabis legal doesn't make sense in a society that allows alcohol and cigarettes. It's not that bad for you, and people are going to smoke through back alley means anyway. Legalizing marijuana makes it more likely that people will buy from trusted sources. The laws against it only serve to promote ""tough on crime"" propaganda that unfairly targets minorities as victims of the law enforcement system.",T,Cannabis legalization,T
35,45,"Abortion is wrong and a sin, a baby is a live person before birth so getting an abortion is murder no different from killing a new born or grown up person.",F,Abortion,F
36,45,I believe if people have an incurable terminal illness or debilitating condition they should have access to euthanasia. People their bodies and lives so should be given the choice of what happens to it. Obviously healthy people should not have access to this.,T,Euthanasia,T
37,45,I agree with letting gay people marry. Marriage equality isn't technically an LGBT issue it is a human rights issue as every adult should be able to enter a consensual marriage with another adult of their choosing.,T,Gay Marriage,T

39,45,"Cannabis should be legalized fully as it is less harmful than alcohol and has many healthy benefits. The industry will also help create jobs, increase government tax revenue and help reduce illegal drug issues.",T,Cannabis legalization,T
40,48,Abortion should be legal. It is always the choice of the woman. This is her body and she has every right to decide. A fetus is technically part of her body until the cord is cut. Let woman choose what's best for their life and body. Keep government out of the decision.,F,Abortion,F
41,48,"The right to die is a difficult subject. If the quality of life is so bad and there is no way to ever recover, then euthanasia should be an option. I worry doctors would rather take this route over conventional medicine to save money. I feel many times its a financial decision more than an ethical decision. I think a change in healthcare laws would prevent people from choosing euthanasia. If they could afford to live, then I believe they would choose life over death.",T,Euthanasia,T
42,48,I grew up in a conservative religious family. My belief of marriage is that it is between a man and a woman. One of our main purposes on this earth from a religious and scientific standpoint is to become adults and reproduce which is the cycle in every living thing. Therefore gay marriage conflicts with these concepts on both sides of the spectrum. If two men or women want to be together that is fine with me. It is the sacred marriage that I have trouble accepting.,T,Gay Marriage,T
43,48,We were built on a nation of migrants. They do the work that many don't want to do. We are a wealthy nation and have the space and resource to help all people. Here they can find a safe and fruitful life. Be able to raise a family and support them. Service to others should a main priority in our morals and values. Let those who are here. stay here without fear or prejudice.,F,Migration,T
44,48,I think this is a made decision to legalize. We don't have enough long term studies to truly no the effects of THC. Any drug you use without moderation is harmful. I think it should only be under a doctors prescription and supervision.This would protect children from using and abuse this drug at an early age.,T,Cannabis legalization,T
45,52,Abortion isn't important. Any opinions were settled in 1974 in Roe V. Wade.,F,Abortion,F
46,52,"I believe it is an individual's choice to die when they choose if they wish. In fact, I think it is the most important decision a person can make. If one is suffering, one should be allowed to stop the suffering. I only fear for the doctor who has to perform the operation, and I understand that some doctors feel this violates the hippocratic oath.",T,Euthanasia,T
47,52,"Gay Marriage is wonderful. In fact, I think it's better to just call it 'marriage.' If two people love each other, they should be allowed to express that love publicly and receive benefits for doing so. At this point, anyone against gay marriage is just wrong.",T,Gay Marriage,T
48,52,Migrants are also not important. Immigration is a system that is beneficial to the country. We should allow more legal immigrants into the country.,F,Migration,T

50,62,"Life is given by God as a gift to mothers. Abortion is the taking away of that life from children that have no choice in the matter. Abortion harms the mother, kills the child, and takes a child out of someone's hands.",F,Abortion,F
51,62,"Euthanasia is a difficult task to talk about since it involves death. But I believe it boils down to the right to liberty, the right to a persons own body, to keep or take their life in times of dire need. Much like the refusal of treatment in hospitals if the patient is able to competently deny treatment, euthanasia should also be allowed for those who deny treatment and want to take their health and life into their own hands, especially and mostly in times of almost certain death and prolonged pain and suffering. I think it should be a last resort, but I think keeping people alive that have no real life to live besides being basically a machine on a bed is not a life worth living.",T,Euthanasia,T
52,62,"I believe gay marriage should be legalized in all cases. I can't imagine any scenario in which gay marriage should not be legal. The only basis for defense against gay marriage is religious and social implications. Otherwise, it should have been legal decades ago.",T,Gay Marriage,T

54,62,"My main problem with cannabis is that it is harmful to people under the age of 18, sometimes 21 depending on the research presented. But cannabis can help with many medical issues, is not addictive, has few to no side effects (based on general research. Some research has shown that excess use can lead to some medical problems, and, as mentioned, in underage users), and is basically impossible to overdose on (again, generally, not counting factors such as driving). It should be treated very similarly to alcohol, requiring carding/containment/legal age usage, but in terms of being legally able to purchase it, it is generally less harmful than alcohol and should be treated in the same category, especially considering that alcohol is never prescribed for medical use, whereas marijuana is.",T,Cannabis legalization,T
55,66,"I totally disagree with abortion. The mother's life is always less important than that of the child, no matter the situation. Abortion is morally wrong, and we should not allow it to remain legal in any state. The mothers put themselves in this state, they should be made to take responsibility for it.",F,Abortion,F
56,66,"I believe in euthanasia. If an illness has progressed to the point that recovery is impossible or unwanted, then the patient should have the option to pass on peacefully. It is a twofold benefit: it relieves them of their pain and suffering, and also keeps unnecessary medical spending at a low, ensuring that the supplies that are going to them are used in more necessary situations. Religion should not be able to legally stand in the way of euthanasia.",T,Euthanasia,T
57,66,"I believe that gay marriage should be legal and socially accepted everywhere. Homosexuality is becoming more socially accepted as time goes on, so we might as well make their unions legal and offer them the same stability and freedoms that are granted to heterosexual couples. I also believe that the right to adopt children should be granted automatically to same sex unions, instead of being the issue that it is. There is no evidence to support that a same sex couple will be any better or worse than a traditional couple.",T,Gay Marriage,T
58,66,"All immigrants are actually criminals. Whether it's just from illegally entering the country, or if they are actually bringing a criminal history along with them, they are committing crimes and we should stop them before the crimes affect us.

59,66,"I agree with cannabis legalization. Cannabis has its own side effects, and it can create its own dependencies, but it is safer by far than alcohol.

65,96,"I believe that abortion is morally and ethically wrong. I believe that life starts at conception and that once the sperm and egg are united, a human soul comes into existence. I think that abortion should be illegal in all cases except the rare case where the mother's life is at great risk if she doesn't have an abortion. I think cases of teen pregnancy, rape, out of wedlock pregnancy, or any other reason besides risk to the mothers life are no excuse for having an abortion.",F,Abortion,T

For example, they take away jobs from Americans and are a drain on the welfare and social services systems.

Still, we are fortunate to be in a time where mother's can make this decision and not harm or kill themselves in the process.

The U.S. government has shown via court rulings that the rights of the fetus outweigh the interests of the mother beyond that point. To me, fights against abortion are often rather fights against the progression of women's rights and their ability to make their own decisions. Allowing abortions has been shown to lower crime rates as well as keep women and children out of situations they could avoid via abortion. Thus, it is in the best interest of citizens to allow abortions freely.",T,Abortion,T

220,203,"I beleive that abortion is killing. A mother should have the right to choose (between her and God). But, the government should put some limits on it (like not beyond a certain week). Failure to do this means that anything can go. Look at New York state. They just passed a law that allows a woman to abort a fetus up until birth. Babies are known to feel pain in the womb. And all babies have souls according to the Bible Abortion is killing, pure and simple. I also beleive in a woman's right to choose as long as it doesn't go against the law of the land.

The choice of the person involved must be done when he or she is only in a right mental state. And a doctor should be present to make sure that things go the right way.

Meaning, if you accidentally get pregnant, or were assaulted which resulted in you becoming pregnant, there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting an abortion. I don't believe a baby is alive until it is nearly out of the womb, and I'm talking days before. I'd like to meet one person who remembers their time in their mother's belly.
