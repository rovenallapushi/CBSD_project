0,2,I believe in a woman's right to choose to abort. It is such a relief to be able to determine I can kill my own child. I am glad to live in a country that allows this practice. The burden of raising kids is a financial one and takes me away from what I want to do with my life.,F,Abortion,F
1,2,I don't believe in taking one's own life. Only God can determine the end of life. This is immoral and wrong. This is painful for living family to witness/see.,T,Euthanasia,F

3,2,We should allow all migrants in to this country. They deserve to have the same benefits citizens do. They should be given food stamps and shelter as well as health care. We should not question where they came from.,F,Migration,F
4,2,I am for cannabis legalization for medicinal purposes only. It has been successful in treating a variety of illnesses/diseases. It is much cheaper than traditional medication. We need to make this legal in all 50 states.,T,Cannabis legalization,T
5,9,Abortion should be up to the parent the parent should 100 percent be certain before they go through the abortion but i believe abortion is the right way to go if the baby will have no quality of life and has a bunch of informities. Abortion should not happen when the child is fully developed.,F,Abortion,T
6,9,I believe euthanasia depends if an animal can physically not go on and doesnt have quality of life but if they euthanize just because the animal is old then i have a problem with it. Vets are to easily euthanizing animals that are adopted wish there was a better way.,T,Euthanasia,T
7,9,Well my opinion about gay marriage is that i dont believe its right god invented a man and a woman adam and eve. But i also believe that i guess if your happy and you dont push it in my face or have to see or hear about it then im fine who am i to judge how someone else lives there life.,T,Gay Marriage,T
8,9,I believe if a migrant wants to come over for the right reasons than im all for it but do it the right legalize way but if there coming over here to sell drugs and illegal activity then im against it.

9,9,I believe cannabis legalization would be awsome if it was legal all over the united states not only would the states profit off it the towns and cities can grow from the profit of marijuana. It also helps pain patients get off those really addictive pain pills that the doctors push onto there patients.,T,Cannabis legalization,T
10,14,Abortion is great! It saves the taxpayers millions for baby's that weren't wanted by the mothers that are killed in the whom. They are alive from when they are born and that's okay that we harvest the living entity that had less potential than it would have if it had been born. It is generally a great thing if the parents are living in poverty or there is only a single mother whom could not afford to care for the baby.,F,Abortion,F
11,14,"I see Euthanasia as a need for those who have the choice a way out. I don't see it as a ""suicide"" because it has more plan and more reason.

15,15,Abortion should be legal. It is every womans choice whether or not she wants the baby that she becomes pregnant with. Pro-choice is the best choice. What if a woman gets raped? She should not have to go through with that. It is her choice.,F,Abortion,F
16,15,"Euthanasia is done to both animals and humans. While many say it is necessary and okay, it hurts me. I do not like it. It is our way of playing God. When we put our animals to sleep it may be a necessary evil, but it does not mean that it doesn't hurt.",T,Euthanasia,T

20,21,This one very much goes against my personal beliefs but okay here we go. Women shouldn't be allowed to get abortions because it isn't their life that they're in control of. They shouldn't have had sex if they couldn't handle the consequences of having babies. Life begins at conception,F,Abortion,F
21,21,"I think people should be able to choose when and how they die. I think no one should be forced to be in misery for every second until they die, if they want to go at the first sign of an incurable wasting disease, why shouldn't they be able to? If someone is fully capable of making such a decision, who are we to decide that they have to live in misery because we want them to? That's messed up. No one exists on purpose, and if someones existence is pure misery why should they be forced to stay around? We can make literally every other decision for ourselves except that one.",T,Euthanasia,T
22,21,"I think gay people should be able to be married just like anyone else. They're people and they can't help who they love more than anyone else. They're born as gay and treating them like something is wrong with them just because they don't love the opposite sex is stupid, don't we have better and more important things to worry about? It's not like there's a population crisis where not enough men and women are attracted to each other to make babies.",T,Gay Marriage,T
23,21,Everyone should just stay in their own countries. Why should my taxpayer money go towards helping someone who isn't even from here and doesn't pay our taxes? I don't care about the bad hombres that come across our border and they should be deported or worse.,F,Migration,F
24,21,"The war on drugs isn't working, and cannabis is less dangerous than alcohol, but alcohol is perfectly legal and there are even commercials for it. Cannabis doesn't hurt anyone and there have been literally zero deaths or overdoses from it. You can't get physiologically addicted to it, although you can be psychologically addicted (just like anything else). Since we can drink alcohol, we should be able to smoke cannabis. Prescription drug painkillers are a huge problem in this country, and if we had cannabis there wouldn't be such a huge prescription drug problem.",T,Cannabis legalization,T
25,22,"Abortion is evil and against the Bible. One should never take a life...under no circumstances, not even rape or incense. It is murder and women should never be allowed to kill the life within them. If God has decided that a woman should carry a baby, then it is never wrong or conceived in sin. A life is sacred. Abortion must be made totally illegal again and Roe v Wade has to be overturned.",F,Abortion,F
26,22,"This is a very difficult subject for me to address. My father was on a respirator/ventilator with lung cancer and we were told that he would never be able to come off the machine. Fortunately, he had been kept sedated the whole time he was on the machines as he was terrified of them. My brother and I made the decision that it was only right to pull the venilator and let nature take its course. Anytime he seemed to rouse or be in pain, morphine was administered to keep him comfortable. We sat there for an agonizing 2 hours, holding his hands and staring at him. It was the most painful decision I have ever had to make but it was the right one.",T,Euthanasia,T
27,22,"Gay marriage has rightfully been legalized in most, if not all, states of the United States. Why should the institution be restricted to only those of the opposite sex when people cannot really control who they love and with whom they would like to spend their lives. There is nothing sinful about homosexuality. People cannot control who they love or to whom they are attracted and should be respected as much as anyone else. It is delusional to think that all gays try to convert others.",T,Gay Marriage,T
28,22,All immigration into the U.S. must be stopped. Our country is being overrun by foreigners who refuse to assimilate into our society. They are mostly criminals and terrorists and present a horrific danger to the U.S. All illegals in this country must be rounded up and sent back to their native countries immediately as they are totally draining all our resources and committing heinous crimes. They are overrunning our cities and undercutting employment for legal citizens.,F,Migration,F
29,22,"I am really on the fence about this one. No, I do not believe, as I was taught in junior high, that cannabis is the gateway drug to heroin addiction. However, I do see the medical benefits of cannabis for certain conditions. On the other hand, I do not want to be driving when someone who is stoned is also driving. In essence, I think there has to be some regulation, not outright outlawing of it but some control of dispensing of it.",T,Cannabis legalization,T
30,35,"I believe every child has a right to live. A woman should not be allowed to take that right away and murder her baby. There should be increased funding for more support for parents, grants and funding for families that want to adopt, and more incentives for adoption. We should spend more time educating on how to raise a child, how to prevent unwanted pregnancy, and put more resources into family planning.",F,Abortion,T
31,35,"I believe there are certain situations and circumstances which should allow for a dignified death by euthanasia. When someone is diagnosed with a terminal illness and is reaching the end, they should be allowed to choose when to go. If someone no longer wants to be a burden on their family and/or is in pain and is suffering, and doctors confirm they have a limited amount of time left to live, and their ""life"" is being spent in a bed 24/7, they should be allowed to pass on painlessly and dignified.",T,Euthanasia,T
32,35,"I believe marriage was intended to be between a man and a woman. However, I do not believe it is the government's job to intervene in someone's personal choice. People should be allowed to marry whomever they chose regardless of gender, as long as it is mutually consented and both parties are adults. My personal opinion is my own opinion, which guides my own choices. My opinion should not dictate the country's laws, especially ones that limit other people's right to the pursuit of happiness.",T,Gay Marriage,T
33,35,"I believe if someone wants to come into the United States, they should do it legally. There are visas available that allow for you to work and visit America. There are also programs for asylum and refugee. If anyone wants to come to into our country, they need to follow our countries rules.",F,Migration,T
34,35,"I believe it is safer for the general population to have cannabis available legally. When someone is taking something, they have a right to know what is in it, especially when there are cases of it being laced with dangerous chemicals. I believe it is safer for all involved to have safety measures in place to confirm the potency and ingredient make-up of cannabis. Additionally, being sold legally incurs taxes which can offset the costs incurred in legalizing the cannabis.",T,Cannabis legalization,T
35,41,abortion should not be legal under any circumstances.,F,Abortion,F
36,41,Euthanasia should probably be legal just cause if someone really doesnt want to live they will off themselves in ways that could possible be detrimental to society like jumping onto train tracks or off of buildings. Also if that person is professionally euthanized then they will likely be subject to less pain than if they were to just commit suicide. Strictly from a pragmatic sense it should be allowed.,T,Euthanasia,T
37,41,I am of the opinion that gay marriage should be a right under the law of any two individuals who wish to be so. As a result of this belief I also believe that gay marriages should be a right guaranteed under the law of any gay couple who should want to be married.,T,Gay Marriage,T

47,49,Gay Marriage should absolutely be permitted. There is no logical reason that it should not.

I view those with some suspicion. I know that in the past tobacco also was claimed to have health benefits. I also think that companies will try to profit from it and try to make it illegal for people to grow it or obtain it without going through corporate profit making channels to obtain it.,T,Cannabis legalization,T
50,50,"Abortion should never be legal. Roe vs Wade gives a woman the right to choose murder, which is a capital crime. The death penalty should be inflicted on women who would choose to murder their own children because of a choice that they made to have sex without protection.",F,Abortion,F

For instance, if someone is dying and in constant pain from a terminal disease, it should be their own decision whether or not they want to end their own suffering.

It is understandable where certain religious groups may take issue with gay marriage, but if that is the case, they shoudn't marry a gay person.

If a grown adult chooses to abuse alcohol, smoke marijuana (or any other kind of illicit substance) they should have every right to do so, as long as their choices do not harm or infringe upon the rights of others. Legalization of cannabis would solve many problems in the United States, including the prison system. Black and Hispanic men are far more likely to be charged and imprisoned for marijuana possession and/or distribution than white people that commit the same 'crimes.' Furthermore, if the government were to oversee and regulate the cultivation and sale of cannabis, the revenue earned could be put to good use in local infrastructure and public school systems.",T,Cannabis legalization,T

The cost of a child is so high too, if you can't afford a baby, you should consider abortion.",F,Abortion,F

89,65,"Cannabis is here to stay and has always been here. The only reason that it is not legal in all states, is that the US Government hadn't figured out a way to tax it and make profit until recently. With the crackdown on illegal drug smuggling, the government has realized that the amount of money that can be made is substantial through legalization.

Furthermore, sometimes abortions are not completed successfully and the baby is born with life long consequences from the botched abortion. There are so many families looking to adopt that there is no reason not to give a baby a fighting chance! I'm also very much against abortion because some women choose to use this as a form of birth control, having several abortions throughout their lives. I think with proper education and resources, there should be a decrease in abortions. Another thing to consider is that an abortion made in a rash decision may become a serious mistake causing the mother heartache for years if not the rest of her life because of the decision. Abortion is not something people should go into lightly, and should ultimately be banned.",T,Abortion,T

There have been instances in the medical field where a medical diagnosis is incorrect and what happens if you are diagnosed, but there is a development that could cure your disease? I think that euthanasia is also very selfish and not right for someone to choose to die and leave their families. The Bible is against suicide and I firmly believe that euthanasia is a form of suicide. Another concern I have regarding euthanasia is what happens if there is a malfunction with the process and it doesn't work? The person would then be forced to suffer in an even worse condition. I think in cases where someone is very sick or has a incurable disease, they should allow things to happen as God would want them to.

Furthermore, what happens if gay couples want to have children? Are the children going to be exposed to this alternative way of life? How would a marriage between two men handle a daughter? Who will teach her how to be a woman? Conversely, what about a marriage between two women with a son? Who will show the child how to become a man?

I think there is also the possibility that these migrants can cause an increase in crime and there have been instances where I have personally seen stories on the news about migrants harming American citizens.

Furthermore, as long as it is properly controlled, I believe economically cannabis legalization can greatly increase revenue for the state and county if taxed and it would also create jobs for people, ultimately helping with unemployment, even if it only helps a little! Additionally, unlike other drugs, marijuana doesn't cause the person who consumes it to be angry or hostile or violent. Also, unlike alcohol, those who use cannabis are not apt to have angry outbursts or make poor decisions.

530,442,"I am ""Pro choice"" if you are looking for a thing to tally. However I do think that there should be limitations.  I have a very off the wall thought process on this. I believe in reincarnation so if a child can't be taken care or will not live a good life (born to a mother who can't afford it, a product of incest, a illness that will not allow for quality of life) then it might be the kinder thing to reset the cycle.  Now as for the limitations they are also from an off the wall thought process. I believe in body autonomy to the point of the baby becoming a being that is viable outside of the womb. Let me explain.  If a baby can not survive on its own outside of the womb then it is technically a parasite something isn't alive yet but something feeding off of the mothers nutrients. When a child is viable outside of the womb it can become a living thing and at that point should not be aborted without an extenuating circumstance, such as rape, incest, or risk of loss of life of the mother or the child.  If the baby or the mothers lives are in danger then it is a medical necessity. If the child will not live outside of the womb anyway it is kinder to not have the woman go through that experience just to bury her baby. and if the mother's life is in danger then again because I believe in reincarnation the baby can be reborn with less damage of hurt feelings. (The parents will mourn yes that is going to happen but an unborn child has not touched as many people as an adult has).

Imagine a situation where a woman is raped and she is pregnant with the rapists baby. Of course the woman would not want to give birth to that child so if she wants to have an abortion then that is her choice.

How can a country such as the United States that was built on a platform of honor and integrity allow such a foul thing as Gay Marriage to be passed in the court of law? Gay marriage goes against all of the values and virtues of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. A country in which the majority of its citizens are believers in God should not have passed a law allowing gay individuals to wed.

I understand that South America does not have very many employment opportunities and that is why we so such an influx of illegal immigration into the United States, however it is important that people who wish to give in the United States follow the immigration laws of the country. It is not right for someone to cross a border and take away resources from legal citizens of this country. Many illegal immigrants are studying in American schools and getting heath care in American hospitals for free or little cost; this is money that would be better spent on legal citizens of the USA.",T,Migration,T
624,500,"I do not agree with the cannabis legalization that has occurred in nearly a dozen states across America. Marijuana is a gateway drug into much more severe narcotics such as cocaine, heroin, and meth. Legalizing cannabis will allow the youth of America to believe that marijuana is just like alcohol and cigarettes. It will make the youth of America curious about the affects of cannabis and make them more inclined to try it. Once they feel the ""high"" that marijuana gives them they will want to try other drugs to feel their ""high"" as well. This a dangerous road to follow. I agree that cannabis should be decriminalized when it comes to handing out sentences in court, but it should not legalized at a recreational level.",F,Cannabis legalization,F
