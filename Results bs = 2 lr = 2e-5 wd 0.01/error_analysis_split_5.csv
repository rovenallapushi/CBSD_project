"I think that abortion should be illegal because it's putting an end to a life, which is the same as murder. Murder is tried in a court of law with penalties as high as the death penalty, or life in prison.",0,1
"I think that those in pain should be given the opportunity to end their life if they want to. Even if they decide not to pursue this option, I believe that in all cases we should provide people with dignity by allowing them to make their own choices, especially about their own lives and about their health.",1,1
"I think that gay marriage should be considered ""marriage"". It should not be differentiated from marriage because all people who want to unite themselves in the eyes of God and the law should be free to do so and should not be discriminated against!",1,1
"I think that we should not allow migrants into our country because they don't share our values and pose a huge threat to our security and safety. They also have a hard time fitting in, don't understand our customs and acceptable behaviors, and often don't speak the same language.",0,1
"I think that Cannabis legalization is a good thing. It helps control and regulate the substance the way that the government does this for alcohol. Cannabis is widely used throughout the world despite lack of government regulation in most countries. However, countries are moving towards legalizing it which is a smart move. Most importantly, it protects young people from accessing it through the black market as easily as adults.",1,1
"I feel as though abortion ought to be the normal course of action, and the only way you get to actually have a baby is if you can provide evidence that you have the mental, emotional, and financial resources to care for it. Otherwise, out she comes!",0,1
"It's a touchy subject. If someone is really in incurable chronic pain, I don't see why they shouldn't be able to check out if they want to. On the other hand who's to make the call on that, or perform the procedure? I don't know how you set that up that it doesn't get messy.",1,1
"I don't think what two adults decide to do is any of my business. If two people feel like getting married, who cares what sort of genitals they have. I mean, I suppose each one of them probably cares, but I don't imagine anyone else would really care too much. Or I guess I should say that no one else really should care, because again, what business is it of their's?",1,1
"I feel like way too many birds migrate these days. There's plenty of birdseed right here on my patio, those birds ought to appreciate a good thing while they have it and just stay put. This migrating is just a pain in the ass and honestly it's kind of insulting.",0,1
"Of course weed ought to be legal. For christ's sake we spent the last how many years hearing about the evils of smoking dope, and then turns out we can legalize it and nothing, literally nothing is the slightest bit different. Of all the ridiculous nonsense.",1,1
Abortion is murder. Fetus is a human. God gives life. No one should take it away.,0,0
People have a right to life. No one has a right to take a life. People are to live as long as God decrees and not take their own or others' life. It is murder.,1,0
Why shouldn't two people who want to marry be allowed to marry? Why does gender have to matter. Rights are basic - no one should be denied the right to marry whom they choose. It is a free country and we should able to do what we want in relationships.,1,1
Let them in. They contribute greatly to our society. They do not drain our resources. They are the same as everyone else.,0,0
Cannabis is bad. It leads to harder drugs. It makes production in the workplace go down. It causes accidents and crime.,1,0
This should not be allowed. It's just not right in the eyes of God,0,0
"I fully support this. We don't let animals suffer, why should a person. It should definitely be a choice rather than laying in a hospital bed waiting to die everyday. Its the humane thing to do, If I was sick and could make the choice - I would.",1,1
"I see nothing against it, some gay couples get along way better than straight ones. Besides, who are they hurting getting married? They should have insurance and tax breaks available that married couples get.",1,1
All migrants should be allowed into the US and given benefits immediately. This will bring in a whole new workforce.,0,1
Cannibis has a lot of health benefits that people don't realize. I think it should be legal and taxed as much as cigarettes.,1,1
"Life begins at conception. That is a scientific fact. Since the right to life is fundamental, no other rights can exist without it, then it trumps all other interests. Therefore abortion should be banned.",0,1
"This should be a right too. Owning ones own body is central to the concept of Individual Rights. But we somehow keep the application of this right illegal when it comes to euthanasia. That's understandable, for moral and practical reasons. One doesn't want to enable troubled people to kill themselves when they could be saved. But philosophically, its an untenable position.",1,1
"Gay Marriage is a constitutional right under the equal protection clause. I would add the 9th amendment as well, as it is consistent with classical liberty, even if the Founders did not think of it as such. Basically, out Regime defaults on individual freedom. And the Government should not be in the business of marriage.",1,1
"Migrants should be treated like criminals. They are breaking the law. We should enforce every law in a draconian manner. If you clamp down on small things, the big crimes disappear as well. This worked in NYC. We should do this to migrants.",0,0
"I am for this based on the inalienable rights that our Regime is founded on. From the very beginning, classic liberalism has had a tendency toward unlimited freedom. That's why John Locke started from a State of Nature and buil governemnt from there. He did not start with a totalitarian state and proceed to wittle it down. In other words, the government must show a compelling reason to make something illegal. If alcohol is legal, then there is no compelling reason to ban pot",1,0
i am pro choice. i believe that woman should have the right to chose whether they want to kill an unborn child god will deal with them... but the government should not dictate to women what to do with their bodies.,0,1
i believe people should have the right to die in cases of terminal illnesses. kavorkian was a hero. a trailblazer. the decision should be up to the patient and its between that person and god.,1,1
"i belive that everyone should have the right to marriage. i believe whether you are hetero or homo sexual you should have the right to get married its only fair for a long term partner in homosexual relationship to be able to have the same benefits as a heterosexual couple. those issues that can arise could be medical issues, pensions, life insurance, etc.",1,1
"we should just let everyone in you know, spread the love. i think all people should be able to just walk on over and thats that. border open to anyone and everyone. hell, its not their fault they weren't born here.",0,0
LEGALIZE IT! legalize it! legalize it! legalize it! 21 and over... treat it like alcohol.. make it federally legal.,1,0
Abortion is murder. Women should not have the right to murder their babies. If they don't want to have babies than they can use birth control instead of murdering their children.,0,0
"Patients who are terminal and have no chance of recovery deserve the right to die with dignity. They should be allowed to choose when and how to die on their own terms instead of a long, painful process that will see their body gradually destroyed. This should be legal to do and legal to assist those who have made this difficult choice.",1,1
"Everyone deserves to marry the person they love, regardless of their gender. Love is love and marriage is marriage. It is not right to deny gay couples this basic human right.",1,0
"Migrants raise the crime rate in our country. They make our country less safe. They bring diseases and hordes of family members with them, contributing nothing to our society.",0,1
"Cannabis should be legalized. It is a real alternative to opiods at a time when they are destroying our country and opioid addiction is through the roof. There has been limited evidence that says cannabis can be used to effectively treat certain diseases along with chronic pain. At the very least, cannabis should be legalized for medical use, but it should ultimately be legalized for recreational purposes as well.",1,1
"Abortion is great. If someone does not want their baby, they can just get rid of it. It is a fantastic service that the world should share in. We can all act as irresponsible morons world round!!!",0,0
"Due to religious and moral reasons it is not right to euthanize a human being. No matter the circumstance or difficulty. One must keep living till God says otherwise. That being said, once more I would ask others not to but not force them one way or another.",1,1
"I personally am not in support due to my religious and moral reasons. That being said, I also will not go out of my way to stop anyone from doing so. I do not believe in forcing my opinions on others. I believe and support freedom of choice.",1,1
I can't stand migrants. It's not like my great grandparents came here from abroad either! Why should we let anyone here? It is only our country and no one else's.,0,1
"I do not support nor oppose this position in the least. I am not really certain it matters either way. If I had to choose, I suppose I would choose to support legalization. For freedom of choice and freedom in general is one of the most important fundamental rights of all.",1,1
"I think that Abortion should be completely banned. Nobody has the right to murder another human being. That includes humans that have not yet been born. Just because some women can't be bothered to use contraceptives and are promiscuous, they think killing their baby is justified. Really it's just a way to keep enjoying their lifestyle of debauchery. Doctors who help women have abortions should be incarcerated.",0,1
"People should have the right to end their life whenever they see fit. If someone is in great pain due to illness or great emotional pain due to other factors and the idea of continuing to live is unbearable enough to want to die, I don't think anyone should stop them. And if they are unable to end their lives on their own due to physical restrictions or just not having the gumption and they request assistance, they should get it. There should be a legal proceeding that involves contracts that indemnifies the person assisting in the suicide. They are providing a valuable service.",1,1
"I think that gay marriage should be legal throughout the country. Marriage is a union between two people who love each other. It shouldn't be restricted to just heterosexual people. If two men or two women want to have the same rights, benefits, and ability to declare their intention to always be with the other, I don't think anyone has the right to deny that to them.",1,1
"Migrants are the biggest plague on our nation. We have so few resources and all these foreigners think they should just be able to help themselves to them. This country is OURS! It was given to us by God. We've protected it from Indians and Canadians for 500 years. It belongs to us. Migrants should just stay home and make the best of their situation. That's what my great grandfather did when he moved here from Ireland. Made the best of a bad situation. And because of him, I am here. MAGA. Trump 2020",0,1
"Marijuana use, whether medical or recreational, should definitely be legal. The medical benefits to using marijuana are too great to ignore. Also, marijuana is no more harmful or addictive than alcohol. It is time that we as people and the government stop trying to decide what is best for us. This infringes on our freedom. Also, legalizing marijuana brings the states that have legalized it already great tax revenue and decreases the crime that occurred due to people who are going to get it one way or another.",1,1
"Abortion should be strictly banned. Much like my opinion on euthanasia, it is up to the life of a person to make the choice to live or not. Since unborn babies can not yet make that choice, it should be the default to give birth to them. Abortion allows for reckless behavior and makes people do things without being concerned with the consequences. Abortion is essentially the murder of a person, and everyone can agree that it is wrong. Money should not be going to abortion procedures when so many find it morally wrong.",0,1
"I think euthanasia should be allowed. If someone is of a sound mind, it should be up to them whether they want to end their life or not. Doctors should provide all possible information so that someone can make an informed opinion, but people should have the ultimate choice. I think counseling should be provided too, possibly with help from the family. If someone still wants to go through with it, than it should be allowed.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage is acceptable. I don't think we should legislate who can and can not get married. If two people are in love and committed to be together, than they should have all of the same rights as others. If church's don't want to allow gay marriage within their confines, that is fine.",1,1
"Immigration is a major problem in our country. We have too many problems right now to deal with the problems of migrants. A lot of the time migrants compound our problems, with higher crime rates, taking jobs, and abusing the welfare system. We need severely limit who can come into this country and take care of ourselves first. Migrants are not very good at assimilating into our culture, many times not even being able to speak English. Migrants need to go back to where they came from and work to fix their own problems there.",0,1
"Cannabis should absolutely be legalized. Cannabis has been shown to be less harmful than many legal vices people use. Cannabis laws currently unfairly target certain groups, so by legalizing a great injustice is being corrected. Cannabis can't be researched unless it is made legal, potentially allowing for medical break through's that could help so many. Lastly, cannabis legalization will help to diminish the profits of gangs and cartels that use the plant to support their criminal activities via black market distribution.",1,1
Abortion is a pleasant alternative to taking care of mistakes when they happen. It provides a option for that mistake in very little discomfort . Especially to all parties involved. It's a recommended choice among many families.,0,1
I could not be more against something. I feel it's personally and morally wrong in general. I can't even bring myself to say the word in any form. I wish that it was not even an option in society.,1,1
I have nothing against gay marriage personally. But the Christian thought process does shadow into my mind making me question. But in knowing this I do realize it's not for me to judge any once person or persons for their choice of wives/husbands in this endeavor. On a personal level it's not a choice I would make.I c,1,1
Migrants should fly south for the winter and stay near the ocean in the spring. They really should learn to be skillful and resourceful of thier own accord. This is considered good prospect for bad behavior. Or sent to a migrant island during transitions.,0,1
There are so many points and views on this however personally I don't know why it isn't legal across the entire united states when it's had so many medicinal values to so many lives. I personally have never used it due to strict laws that govern and prohibit it. But I see the value in life as an alternative to other more dangerous substances.,1,1
"I think abortion should be illegal. A woman can have an abortion without the father of the child's permission, and that is simply unfair. It is wrong to allow helpless children to be killed by abortion. That child deserved a chance at life no matter what, even if it would have been born with a disability. Even if a woman is in danger from childbirth, it is still wrong to end the child's life, when there is only a risk of death involved.",0,1
"When an animal is sick, we think it is inhumane to let them suffer. Why is it the opposite for a person who is sick and wishes to be euthanized? If they are in pain and wish to end their suffering, it should be their decision and no one else's. It may be hard for their family but they have to understand that it is not only their choice. There are also situations where someone is mentally incapable of making the choice, and if it is in their will, the family should also be able to make that decision for them.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage is a human right. Even if religious people use the idea that marriage is only between a man and a woman, there are now things such as tax benefits for married people. It is wrong to deny gay people the same benefits that straight couples have. They are doing nothing wrong, and it does not affect anyone other than themselves. It should definitely be legalized.",1,1
"Migrants should never be allowed into our country without the proper documentation. Even if they are refugees, our country does not have the resources to save every person looking for a better life. It would be detrimental to our country allowing these people to take our precious jobs. We must always believe in our country first and not allow anyone that would possibly damage a family that is already here.",0,1
"Cannibis legalization should be allowed on a federal level. There is a huge potential for sales industry, as well as tax income, by letting all states grow cannabis and freely trade between. States like Oregon have a surplus of cannabis, and it would make sense to allow them to export their product to balance the market. There is no proof that legalizing cannabis increases cannabis use among teenagers. It removes the need for a black market and makes things safer for everyone.",1,1
I think that it is a womans right to choose whether or not to have a child.  I think that the Row Vs. Wade decision is in jeapordy in our current climate.  Late term abortions are uncommon and used to protect the safety of the mother.  Abortions would become much more dangerous if outlawed.,1,1
Suicide is wrong in any case  Euthanasia should be banned in every case  Sick people cannot make their own decisions to end their own lives  Euthanasia is immoral,0,0
Gay marriage is immoral  Gay marriage is detrimental to the countries morals  Gay marriage is unnatural  Gay marriage is dangerous to the youth,0,0
I think that immigration is one of Americas great strengths  Immigration brings a steady group of motivated people driven to advance their lot in life  Immigration adds to national diversity  Immigration is under attack in our current climate,1,1
Cannabis should be legalized and taxed  Medical marijuana has been shown to have successful results  Pharma companies are against the legalization of marijuana  a majority of citizens favor legalization,1,1
"I believe that abortion is immoral unless the life of the mother is truly in danger. In other words, the mother will die or suffer devastating physical results. The reason why I believe this is simple. The unborn baby is a human being that is alive. It feels pain. Death cannot come with pain and I don't believe we have the right to inflict pain and death on another human being. I do believe we must have many more resources in place to help women who are pregnant so that they don't suffer from an unwanted pregnancy.",1,1
"People have the right to end their own lives. It is their life and they can do with it as they choose. It's no one's business except the person and their doctor. If the doctor says they are terminal or they have a condition that is devastating, they should be able to end their life. Society should stay out of that situation and let it be a private thing.",0,1
I think that marriage should be open to two consenting adults. They can be two men or two women. I don't think we have the right to decide who people want to marry. It is their own personal business. Gay marriage has no affect on society in a negative way.,0,1
"I believe we should secure the boarder against people who want to enter the US illegally. Once that happens, I believe we should allow many more migrants to enter the US on some type of guest worker program. Make it much easier, after a careful screening. Migrants are usually hard working, honest people who are looking for a better life. If they can work and pay taxes, we should welcome them. If we have a secure border and a careful screening process, we can let in those wonderful people who can enhance our country.",1,1
I think that cannabis should be legalized in some forms. I believe that we can allow limited use. It should be regulated in the same way that alcohol is regulated. Then people can responsibly use cannabis. We can ensure the quality of the product. We can cut down on those who engage in crime related to cannabis. We can provide relief to those who can use it medically.,1,1
Abortion is not to be used as a form of birth control. It is a choice that is available. It is necessary as a way to prevent unwanted life. It has been a hot topic for a very long time now.,1,1
It should never be done. The elderly and terminally ill should suffer to their very dying breath. No one should have the option to end their own life. Life is owned by the world as a whole not by the individual.,0,1
It is a necessary recognition in the USA. We have gone far too long not acknowledging these people's rights. The bible clearly says love thy neighbors. It is a very natural thing for people of the same sex to love each other.,0,1
"Migrants as a whole are not a bad thing. They are just people trying to make it from one place to another and live. However illegal immigration is a bad thing. I think only a handful of illegal immigrants are here because they really have no other option, but the majority are here with no regard to our laws.",1,1
There is no reason to legalize marijuana. There is no use for it. It is no different than people doing other recreational drugs. It is not like alcohol as some claim.,1,1
"I think abortion should be completely legal and unrestricted by the government. I do not think it is anyone's business what a woman decides to do with her body or what is best for her - ESPECIALLY a man. There are plenty of things people could spend their time legislating, but a woman's body should not be one of them. There are many valid reasons why a woman could choose to terminate a pregnancy but bottom line - it's no one's business but hers. Wouldn't it be better to abort an unwanted or unhealthy baby than to bring something into this world that you're not equipped to care for? Are we not overpopulated as is? Why would we force a woman to have a child when we are already running out of natural resources?",1,1
"Allowing for euthanasia is plain and simple a crime. This is suicide and you should not be allowed in heaven. Killing oneself is a sin as defined by the bible and doctors should be ashamed of themselves for condoning such behaviors. It does not matter how sick or lifeless you have become, the Lord is the only person who decides when your time is up. It should not be up to a sick individual to make this kind of life-altering decision especially when they're in such a low mental state. Place your faith in the Lord and he will deliver you from these circumstances and if it is your time to go, he will take you. Choosing suicide will only give you a one way ticket to Hell.",0,0
The bible states that marriage should take place between exactly one man and woman. No more. No less. Why have we decided to bastardize this most pure of doctrines? Why would we let some people reduce marriage to a sham by allowing a man to marry a man or a woman to marry a woman? What's next?! Will we stop at nothing? Will it eventually be okay for someone to marry their llama? Gay people should not be allowed the same rights as normal people and they especially should not be allowed to adopt children. Children need a mother and father and no one else is equipped to be a parent.,0,1
"America was founded by immigrants, built by immigrants, and built upon a philosophy of accepting those in need. What is written on the Statue of Liberty? I don't think it's ""give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses so I may send them away and discriminate against them"". It's quite the opposite actually. How can we stand here and think we deserve to live in this country when they only thing different about us is that we happened to be born on this soil? Who cares?! Even those immigrants who have come here illegally should be offered a path to citizenship. Saying that they take our jobs is complete bull considering Americans wouldn't deign to do those jobs anyway. They aren't taking our resources because they HAVE NO RIGHTS and are not protected under our laws!! Everyone has spent way too much time believing the hateful rhetoric spewed by the right-wing propaganda machine about how migrant=rapist/criminal/drug-lord. None of these things are true. Most are women and children fleeing violence and seeking asylum. Who are we to turn them away?",1,1
"There are so many more hurtful substances than Cannabis in this world - many of them legal in the United States! With the exception of a prescription, there is nothing that stops you from taking painkillers or benzos. These things are highly addictive and lead to far worse and long-lasting problems. Notice how no one talks about a marijuana epidemic? But they sure do talk about an opioid crisis. Or how about alcohol? How many people do you know with a DUI? Have you ever lost someone you love to a drunk driver? I sure have. But you know what I haven't lost anyone to? Marijuana. I've never seen a high person acting the way drunks act. Marijuana is only addictive in the psychological sense that ANYTHING could be. It's not cancer-causing like cigarettes and doesn't cause organ failure or cirrhosis like alcohol. Legalize marijuana and you generate extra revenue for states and cities and reduce the reliance of the sick on dangerous pharmaceuticals.",1,1
"I do not believe in abortion and feel that it is wrong. To me, a fetus is life, and life should not be taken so easily. At the same time, I feel that it is your choice on what you do with your body and I will not condemn someone for having an abortion. My heart just mourns the potential that is lost when the baby is ripped from its mother's womb.",1,1
"Your are killing an innocent animal! Put them all on on an island somewhere to leave out there days. Euthanasia is wrong, even if its mercy killing! It should be illegal",0,0
Gay marriage is against most culturals and religions. Do not legalize it! It does not belong in our country! Send them somewhere else they want to do that! They are all queers,0,0
"I understand why people seek out a better life. They are doing what they must to provide for their family. With that being said, I don't condemn migrants and but understand the need to not let everyone in the U.S. Therefore, I am nuetral to migrant policy.",1,1
I would legalize it. There are other drugs that are actually bad for you and are worth more consideration. Cannabis has health perks. Just put stipulations on no driving or operating machinery like they do other drugs/medications,1,0
"I feel abortion is an abhorrent act. No one person has the right to determine whether or not another may live. If the life was started, it should be permitted to run its course. However, I also feel that no person should be the enforcer of his or her own morals onto the actions of another; God will judge the sins of all in the end.",1,1
People don't have the right to end their own lives. They must live out every excruciating moment they've been given as each moment given to us is meant to test us.,0,1
Homosexuals should be ashamed of their efforts to claim the right to marriage. They distort the sanctimony of the holy union between man and woman.,0,0
"I feel that migrants who have worked to enter this country in a legal manner, have the intention of becoming naturalized citizens, and plan to be an industrious member of society should be welcomed with open arms. Those who enter under guile and deception should be turned away.",1,1
Everyone should be able to consume whatever they wish so long as they are not causing harm to others which is not a typical result of cannabis.,1,1
It is wrong to kill. Abortion is taking away a human life. If your mother choose abortion you would not be here. Human life is sacred.,1,0
If quality of life is not worth living euthanasia is an option. When you feel life has come to an end you should be able to decide. A choice of euthanasia should be an individual decision. It is your life.,0,1
People should be able to marry who they want. Love has no boundaries. Caring individuals should be able to express themselves. A piece of paper showing their love.,0,1
Migrants need a chance to succeed. We should help legally. Giving migrants hope is essential. Migrants can help America.,1,1
Cannabis legalization will cause problems. Just as alcohol has cannabis will destroy lives. Another gateway drug. Unbelievable that what was illegal is now okay.,1,1
"I feel that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. In cases of rape, I feel that one should be able to have an abortion. In cases of incest, for example a father having sex with his unwilling daughter (rape) abortion should be an option. I do not feel abortion should be a birth control method after the fact.",1,1
"There is no reason for euthanasia. People with terminal illnesses can be given medications that help with the pain of dying. Euthanasia is no better than suicide and would be considered sinful. People are meant to die when it is their time, we can't just play God.",0,1
I think gay marriage is completely wrong. God says that marriage should be between a man and woman and anything else is disgusting. Gays should not be allowed to marry and be rewarded for their sins.,0,1
I feel that those who want to enter the US should do so legally. Migrants should be able to come here and get jobs and live a better life. I think that so long as laws are followed there is no issue. I also feel that if migrants break our laws on a regular basis there should be consequences to that.,1,1
"I feel cannabis should be legalized. Cannabis could be taxed like tobacco and alcohol and that money could be used by government to improve conditions across the board. I do not feel like there is any reason not to legalize. There should be a set of rules in place for cannabis, but it should not be illegal.",1,1
Individual women should be able to make decisions about whether or not to have abortions.,1,1
Euthanasia is wrong and people should not have the power to make life or death decisions.,0,1
I believe marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.,0,1
"We should have immigration policies that treat migrants with dignity and humanity, folks seeking asylum as refugees especially.",1,1
Cannabis ought to be legalized and regulated as alcohol is.,1,1
"I think abortion should be legalized. I think the stigma surrounding it needs to change before we see any meaningful conversation open between opposition. I value the life of a woman, as well as support their autonomy over their own bodies'. Women should be able to choose whether or not to carry a fetus to term.",1,1
"Euthanasia is abhorrent. Man does not have any right to take that which was given to him by God. Not to mention to spit in the face of humanity. Their forefathers brought them to this moment in their lives, and they choose to take their own lives. Cowards.",0,0
"I think gay marriage was the first step in America's downfall. After being forced to live with them for more than 35 years, we thought that was the end of it. But now it is being put into movies and television. And commercials! I cannot escape it! Gay marriage makes normal marriage seem like a joke! If anyone can get married to anything, it devalues normal marriage.",0,1
"I'll be honest, this is a topic that I do not know much about, statistics wise. I don't want to keep people out of our country, that's for sure. I just wish we had a cohesive plan to integrate foreigners into the US. We all need to have a plan to integrate current US citizens into accepting new people. It's one of those issues that makes me want a world where the masses are controlled, because we cannot be left to our own devices.",1,1
"I definitely think Cannabis should be legalized. Many states have already legalized Cannabis in one form or another, but it still remains illegal federally. We did just see the legalization of hemp. Great step for renewables! Marijuana as a drug is relatively harmless. Mental addiction is a real concern and we need to stop the spread of misinformation about addiction. But, I know it can be used recreationally just like alcohol, so I do not see the harm in legalization.",1,1
I believe abortion should be the womans choice. I dont agree with government telling a woman what she can and can not do with her body. Abortion should be legal up to a certain month of term or it should be a forced adoption. Too many woman have unwanted babies and I am tired of supporting them.,1,1
I do not agree with euthanasia because most of the time when people make this choice they are sick and may not be in their right frame of mind to make such a decision. I believe people should live out their lives naturally.,0,1
I do not agree with gay marriage at all. Same sex couples are not normal. I dont understand how someone could marry someone and have a family with someone of the same sex.,0,1
I believe we should take care of our own people before doing so much to help imigrants. There are far too many people in the United States who are homeless and hungry and we continue to bring in migrant peoples and take care of them. It truly saddens me.,1,1
"Legalization of cannabis is honeslty something I have not given much thought to. I am not a ""weed smoker"" so it makes no difference to me. The only thing I would suggest is to make it legal but government controlled... and have the profits offset our taxes, give the people some of their own money back.",1,1
"I believe abortion should only be performed in severe cases such as rape or incest. I fully believe in a woman's right to choose, but it just shows recklesness to get pregnant and abort the baby. I strongly believe that if you're grown enough to have sex then you should be ready to accept the responsibilities of having a baby. I also don't consider the ""morning after"" pill to be abortion because the baby hasn't developed a heartbeat or anything along those lines.",1,1
"Euthanasia is an abomination and a sin against God. God is the only one who decides who lives and dies, no matter what the circumstance is. As I stated above, it's a very slippery slope that will eventually result in individuals who are depressed having the ability to die on their own accord.

"Gay marriage should never be legal because it's against the Bible. The Bible clearly states that marriage is between a man and woman and nothing else. Not only would gay marriage ruin the bond of marriage, but it would lead to uncomfortable situations with the children of these same sex couples. It should never be allowed in the United States because it' s a very slippery slope going forward from there and everyone will start getting special privileges.",0,1
"I'm definitely against illegal immigrants coming to this country. We have specific laws and legislation in place to accept any immigrant legally. I feel like any illegal migrants who enter the country make it unfair for those who have waited years to become legal citizens. This country was founded on immigration, but it was legal immigration. My ancestors waited on Ellis Island to be documented and fully embraced our country and flourished.",1,1
"Cannabis should definitely be legal for recreational and medicinal use all across the United States. Not only is it natural but it has a plethora of positive health benefits to combat pain, epilepsy, and many other conditions. All the government needs to do is tax this and it takes away all the money flowing to the cartels around the world. Another reason to legalize cannabis is to reduce the amount of opioid use, which is a major epidemic all across the country.",1,1
I think abortion should be illegal. Life starts at the moment of conception and any attempt to end it should not be legal. Whether or not that life is ended should be left up to God.,1,1
I think it should be allowed for us to put the sick and elderly out of their misery if they want it to be so. It's not up to us to make them stay here when they are so miserable.,0,1
I think it's abhorrent that these people think that they should be allowed to marry one of the same sex. Why do they feel the need to change the definition of what a marriage is: a legal arrangement between two people of the opposite sex. They will burn in hell!,0,1

"I think ultimately abortion should be left up to the woman carrying the fetus what she decides to do. The immoralities and stigma surrounding the subject are usually beneficial to the opposite sex, who don't have the same experiences of carrying a baby to term. Especially in the scenario of rape, incest, or other abusive situations where a baby may cause more harm than good to an already detrimental case. There should be a limit on when an abortion can be had based off the developmental stages of the unborn child.",1,1
"I think it's perfectly fine to submit a human or otherwise animal to the irreversible effects of euthanasia. Assisted suicide or not, one should have the right to decide whether or not they want to live and this seems like the perfect substance to warrant that action. Doctors and hospitals everywhere should offer this as a program for those suffering with depression.",0,1
"I think Gay marriage is an abomination to the sacred tether that binds the unification between a man and a woman. If you aren't sticking to the natural laws made by the biological miracle that conceptualizes birth, than you are forgoing an abominable act on the human race. Gay people are not genuinely entitled to practicing something intended for two people of the opposite sex.",0,1
"I think the United States is the most beautiful country and best place to live in the world - to share that sacred feeling with others should be a gift. I do agree that people who come to the United States for residency should do so by the books, as does the people who were born here have to as well. There is no reason why someone who was born in the US shouldn't have access to health care or government aid, but someone who comes here illegally does without documentation.",1,1
"Cannabis should be able to be used by patients openly and freely, for the sake of medicine or rehabilitation from harder substances. The plant can be helpful for major traumatic injuries, psychological distress, anorexia, PTSD, and more. Law officials should seek out harder drug cartels or law breakers besides that of cannabis. I believe it's healing benefits should be destigmatized, but also still readily available to the public, not having the quality limited by government regulation",1,0
"I think abortion should be allowed up until the third trimester. By that time, the mother should have decided whether she wants the baby or not. Having an abortion at this stage is essentially killing a baby because the baby has already developed into a human being. Keep in mind that it is possible for babies to be born during the third trimester, so killing one at this stage is wrong.",1,1
"People who are undergoing terminal illness should undergo euthanasia because it saves money for the hospital and the family. Instead of having a patient be treated for years in a hospital, you can just cut the cord right there and forget about your incredibly large medical bill. It's not like they can feel it anyway. It might also be a relief on the family so that they can collect the will ASAP.",0,1
Gays shouldn't be allowed to marry because I believe marriage is solely between a man and a women. Whenever I see a gay couple i get disgusted and have to cover my boys eyes because its just so wrong and immoral. i don't want them gays showing me and my family what they're all about. They're coming into my life with that and affecting it.,0,1
"I would like to help those suffering or who need asylum, but there is a reason why countries have borders.

This is not an American concept. This is a universal concept of sovereignty.",1,1
"Cannabis should be legalized because it would decriminalize it and prevent a lot of the gang culture and stigma around it. Young teenagers who have previously gotten into trouble for it would no longer be, and would become productive citizens instead of going to jail and having their lives ruined. The perception towards cannabis is bad and needs to change. It could also be used for the government to tax and make more money.",1,1
Abortion is great. It celebrates the right of every woman to choose whether or not the child that they're bearing and provides a way out for mothers than cannot afford to raise a child or do not want to raise a child due to the emotional harm it would do them as in the case of a child conceived due to rape.,0,1
"Euthanasia as a whole, I think is wrong. Yes, it saves countless taxpayers dollars as well as each family's money to chemically ""pull the plug"" rather than keep someone alive that has a poor quality of life. However, I believe that death should be a natural process.",1,1
"I think acting on homosexual impulses is morally reprehensible but it is an individual's right to choose their partner. I am conflicted on the topic because although I think it is wrong, many were born that way and cannot change the fact that they like the same sex.

"If someone is near the end of their life or in a lot of pain, they should be given the option to die without pain and suffering. There's nothing wrong with letting someone die if it means they stop suffering and it is what they want. Doctors should be allowed to offer a painless death to patients who are interested.",1,1

Abortion should be made illegal in all U.S. States. With our current medical technology there is no reason for a woman to have an abortion - we can deliver babies prematurely and even perform surgeries in the womb. If a woman is pregnant it is her fault that she didn't use proper birth control or plan for the child. In the cases of rape - most likely the woman did something to let the man know she wanted sex anyway so it is on her to carry the baby to term - if she doesn't want it she can put it up for adoption.,0,1
"The United States as a whole (not just certain individual states) should allow euthanasia for medical reasons. If an individual is suffering from a terminal disease (cancer, Alzheimers, etc.) and wants to end their life that should be their choice and option. The medical community needs to embrace this choice made by a suffering patient and allow this option. There will be a lot of lobbying and push back from religious communities on this topic, but I believe that in the end people can all agree on the fact that the dying should not be made to suffer a prolonged death lingering in pain.",1,1
I am in favor of gay marriage. People should be able to marry the person they love regardless of gender and enjoy the same rights and privileges as a heterosexual married couple. Gay marriage is not harmful to anyone and will not hurt existing heterosexual married couples in any way. I believe that all the rallying against gay marriage is just driven by fear.,1,1
"Migrants should not be allowed into the United States. The U.S. has enough of its own problems to solve (homelessness, poverty, joblessness).

Other countries like Canada or European nations (Germany, France, the U.K.) can step up and take on the migrant problem.",0,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized. Cannabis has no medical benefit and has not been proven to cure anything. Cannabis is a gateway drug that will only encourage users to try other drugs such as heroin, etc. Legalizing cannabis will just lead users to push for legalization of all drugs.",0,1
"abortion is good. its highly recommended to get abortion for at least 2 childs .Everyone makes decisions that are informed by their current circumstances and what resources are available to them to keep themselves healthy and thriving. This includes decisions we make when it comes to choosing a method of birth control. Typically, obtaining contraception is easier than accessing abortion services and there is no evidence that shows people useabortion as a primary method of birth control. That said, having access to one service does not mean we might not need access to the other. Abortion is one part of a comprehensive package of sexual health services. Most people who get abortions report using contraception during the month they became pregnant. No one can assume or know the reasons why someone may face an unplanned pregnancy. Needing an abortion may be due to contraceptive failure (i.e., a condom breaking, getting pregnant despite being on the pill, etc.), a lack of access to accurate reproductive and sexual health information, a lack of access to accessible and affordable birth control methods, or sexual assault. Regardless of the circumstances, people facing unplanned pregnancies have a right to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including abortion services.",0,1
"Euthanasia is the great pain reliever. with out this most of the patients would have died in pain.Euthanasia (from Greek: εὐθανασία; ""good death"": εὖ, eu; ""well"" or ""good"" – θάνατος, thanatos; ""death"") is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. There are different euthanasia laws in each country.Euthanasia is categorized in different ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, or involuntary. Voluntary euthanasia is legal in some countries. Non-voluntary euthanasia (patient's consent unavailable) is illegal in all countries. Involuntary euthanasia (without asking consent or against the patient's will) is also illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder.[6] As of 2006, euthanasia is the most active area of research in contemporary bioethics.[7] In some countries there is a divisive public controversy over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of euthanasia. Passive euthanasia (known as ""pulling the plug"") is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia however is legal or de facto legal in only a handful of countries (e.g. Belgium, Canada, Switzerland) and is limited to specific circumstances and the approval of councilors and doctors or other specialists. In some countries such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, support for active euthanasia is almost non-existent.",1,1
"gay marriage is a great thing. we should respect ones choice and their personal preference. Same-sex marriage is also referred to as gay marriage, while the political status in which the marriages of same-sex couples and the marriages of opposite-sex couples are recognized as equal by the law is referred to as marriage equality.Opposition to same-sex marriage is based on claims such as the beliefs that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples.[8] These claims are refuted by science which shows that homosexuality is a natural and normal human sexuality, that sexual orientation is not a choice, and that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well or even better than the children of opposite-sex couples.[9]",1,1
"policy on migrants should be banned. people should do what ever they like.Migration can be an emotional and divisive issue – within the politics of many countries, within the communities it affects and even within families and friendship groups.

"cannabis is a drug. lethal drug that could kill every one. If pot is legal, more people will use it.  As drug policy undergoes big changes, I’ve been watching rates of youth cannabis use with interest. Whether you like the plant or not, as with alcohol, only adults should be allowed to partake of intoxicating substances. But youth cannabis use is near its highest level ever in the United States.  In Portugal, by contrast, youth rates fell from 2002 to 2006, after all drugs were legalized there in 2001. Similarly, a 2011 Brown University-led study of middle and high school students in Rhode Island found no increases in adolescent use after the state legalized medical marijuana in 2006.  As for adult use, the numbers are mixed. A 2011 University of California at Berkeley study, for example, showed a slight increase in adult use with de facto legalization in the Netherlands (though the rate was still lower than in the U.S.). Yet that study and one in 2009 found Dutch rates to be slightly lower than the European average. When the U.S.’ 40-year-long war on marijuana ends, the country is not going to turn into a Cheech and Chong movie. It is, however, going to see the transfer of as much as 50 percent of cartel profits to the taxable economy.",0,1
"Abortion is not right because all lives matter, even the unborn. Abortion should be heavily restricted, if not completely illegal, because fetuses and embryos will be born into precious little blessings of children, whom may cure cancer someday. If women have the right to choose when they have an abortion, it will lead to willy-nilly abortions whenever a woman wants. Abortion is murder.",0,0
"Euthanasia is good in cases where the patient truly has no chance of coming back to life. Patients who are in prolonged comas, left brain dead, or are terminally ill and in significant pain may benefit from the act of euthanasia. Doctor-assisted euthanasia is ultimately a better and safer alternative than self-inflicted suicide. Consent with euthanasia can be tricky, however if a patient has previously mentioned or consented to something of that nature prior to coma to a trusted family member or friend may be helpful in the decision.",1,1
"I am happy that gay marriage has become legalized across the U.S. It is wonderful that two people who love each other can get married and start a family together regardless of gender. Gay marriage gives the same rights to the LGBTQ+ community as heterosexual couples. Gay marriage also allows for couples to adopt more easily than unmarried couples, which helps gay couples to start a family and give a home to a child who needs it.",1,1
"We should not allow people to immigrate into the US for work; we have enough citizens who don't have jobs who need them. Migration will lead to a whole mess of problems within the economy, leading to more people in the country diluting the work among them.

Policies on migrants should be strict because we don't want to allow our country to get too loose.",0,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized. Cannabis has been proven to make people lazy and leads to psychosis in anyone who uses it.

"Euthanasia is a very difficult topic due to many possible unpleasant scenarios, but ultimately it should be up to the person wishing to die to make that decisions. Provided there are clearly set out guidelines as to who should be permitted to assist in a person's death and to ensure that the person concerned actually does wish to die, there can be no reason not to make this an option. There are terminally ill people in this world who are in a lot of pain and will never recover - who are we to determine whether or not they should linger?",1,1
"There is absolutely no reason why people of the same sex should not be permitted to marry and benefit from all that entails, both from a governmental standpoint and also to benefit from the same recognition and understanding that heterosexual couples receive. Gay people are no different than anyone else, and to deny them something based on their sexual preferences is as discriminatory as banning inter-racial marriage or preventing a person of color from entering a restaurant based on their color. If a church does not wish to perform a marriage ceremony for a gay couple, that is their prerogative. However, a Justice of the Peace is paid to provide such services and must do so under law.",1,1

"Abortion is causing the population of our country to fall. Due to the rise in popularity of abortion over birth, the total population of our country is set to decrease by 10% in the next 5 years.

"I believe that people love who they love whether it be in a relationship that is same sex or opposite sex. As such, marriage should be legal union between two consenting adults. Freedom to marry who we please should be covered under the bill of rights and should be legal. I know people who are gay that struggle with relationships because there is no promise of forever after. I also know straight people who struggle with the same problems in their relationships, lack of commitment. When you marry someone, it is a commitment and a promise that should not exclude gay couples.",1,1
"The government has relented on its strict policy of accepting migrants. Migrants will now be allowed to enter the US after a short interview process.

The federal government under intense pressure will put legalization of cannabis to a nationwide vote on the 2020 ballots. This means there is a good chance that cannabis will be legalized nationwide. Southern states are fighting this the most because it will decrease the prison population and cause a loss of jobs. Jobs that are necessary to police for cannabis and guard prisoners as a result of the cannabis trade. It would be a great victory for all if cannabis legalization passes.,0,1
I think abortion is horrible and people should not do it. There is a life inside of their body that they're killing. Although if you can't afford a child the rest of the world can pay for so you shouldn't worry about it. Keep being you and keep letting the rest of the world pay for your fun.,0,1

"Abortion only includes the woman's choice and does not give the man the choice to be a father. I find it hard to determine when human life actually begins.

If we can help a person who is going to die no matter what get the chance to go on their own terms, we should. It sounds terrible, but we don't force dogs and cats to live through pain and suffering if we know they can't be saved, why would we do that to people? If a medical team is able to consult and assist the person with making their choice when they are going to die no matter what, they should have the option to die peacefully and medically assisted.",1,1
I believe everyone should be able to be legally married. I see no logical reason why they would not be able to. Basing your opinion on who should be allowed to be legally married on religion seems close minded to the religious or non-religious views of others. Marriage is a legal contract and there is no reason a gay couple should be blocked from entering that contract.,1,1

We can make the wealthiest Americans pay for the migrants through increased taxation.",0,0
"Cannabis has been proven to help people with many medical conditions live more comfortably. In addition, our society has become so complex and stressful that many people need a way to manage their anxiety and stress. Smoking a joint or eating an edible helps them calm down, thereby decreasing the chance that they will become unruly or take their anger out on others. Still others want to party on their days off to blow off steam. By legalizing cannabis, all who want it can safely buy it without fear of arrest, and a lower cost than if it were illegal.",0,1

"Abortion is a moral failure of a society that does not value the sanctity of life. Once a woman becomes pregnant, she has a human life inside of her and should never have a say in whether that life could be murdered. Make no mistake, abortion is murder! Any person who considers themselves a moral individual should advocate for an end to this barbaric practice and provide women at risk for this issue all the resources they need to choose life.",0,1
The ability to terminate life should be solely the decision of the person who's life is at stake. In many cases these individuals quality of life is extremely grim and the ability to terminate suffering should be celebrated from a human rights perspective. Whether someone stays alive in a suffering state or chooses to end it should never be restricted by a state or federal body. Individual freedom of their own self should be held in the highest regard and their wishes should be respected.,1,1
"Gay marriage is a civil rights issue that was correctly decided by the Supreme Court. There should never have been a restriction on gays being able to marry. While the issue never reached the social outrage as the 60's civil rights movement, the government bowing to the religious community should have never been allowed under our constitution. Individual states should have never had the authority to restrict or define the definition of marriage.",1,1
"America should be open and accepting of migration, specifically legal migration. Every country in the world has the right to choose for themselves not only the quality of migrant that should be allowed but also the nationality of the individual.

"I personally believe the mother of said fetus/child has full rights to her body and what she chooses to do with it.

It is a difficult decision for a woman to make in general, let alone all the crazy attacks, comments, and 3rd party beliefs about what they chose to do. There are also situations in which I feel like an abortion may be best for the mothers emotional health, as well as the potential child's physical and emotional health (in a scenario when rape or incest is involved and conception occurs). There are many many reasons why I am pro-choice but these are a few of them.",1,1
"Euthanasia is inhumane. There is absolutely no reason why there is an overpopulation in shelters or local areas that house unwanted animals and I don't think any situation ultimately requires euthanasia.

There are people who have many many animals and are able to take care of them, those kinds of people should be taking the animals that would be euthanized. Too many cats, kittens, puppies, and dogs are put down for unnecessary reasons every day. You should always research no-kill shelters in your area when looking for animals to rescue or when surrendering or taking an animal in that you found and cannot locate the owner.",0,1
"I think that gay marriage is unacceptable. I feel that marriage should be reserved for the courtship and gathering of families between a woman and a man, only. Not a man and a man or a woman and a woman.

I feel that it is a genetic disorder that can be passed down but can also be forced on a person due to traumatic experiences - however, whatever the 'cause' it should not be accepted or allowed.",0,1
"America was founded by immigrants, and America is a better place overall because of immigrants. There are downsides of illegal immigrants, of course, and I do believe that all immigrants should do so legally and follow all the requirements to become an American citizen unless on a Visa, but once the Visa expires they should be required to return home, or be placed in a program to gain citizenship. Migrants do many great things, and provide many great and needed services daily. They contribute to their communities and most (not all, but a lot of them) are genuinely decent human beings with good intentions. But I do not think a ""wall"" should be built or that immigrants or refugees should be discriminated against, mistreated, or unable to enter our great country.",1,1
"Cannabis should never be legalized. All the studies about the medical benefits can not be true. Cannabis is a drug and should be banned for the side affects it causes its users. Fatigue, sleepiness, hunger, and loss of ambition are just a few of the side affects and these can cause many larger issues when cannabis is used when/before driving or operating large machines. I also do not think that legalizing a drug such as marijuana can actually show economic growth and change in the communities in which it has been legal and feel it would cause Americans to become lazy, unemployed, and overweight.",0,1
I believe there are many reasons why a woman may choose abortion and it is not the government's right to limit or regulate that medical choice. it is between a woman and her physician. I believe those who would limit this are doing so mainly out of religious reasons and that religious considerations have no place in reproductive rights.I believe that it is a form of patriarchal and misogynist leftovers from our past that make so many institutions involve themselves in this debate. I believe that the abortions should be done as early as possible in the life of the pregnancy.,1,1
"I believe there should be euthanasia available to everybody, not only for the sick but also for the sad and lonely. I think it should be something people are cool with. I believe it is your choice when you die, not someone else's.",0,1
"If God wanted us to marry those of our own sex, He would have said so in the Bible. Gay marriage is just making something legitimate that actually disgusts a lot of people. And they shouldn't be allowed to raise children either. It should be something they are discouraged from doing, not given more rights to continue.",0,1
"There are real dangers that exist for many people in their native lands. it is the duty of those who are better off to help these refugees from bad situations, whether the situation is crime, war, poverty, or natural disaster-related. The founding principle of the United States was to provide freedom for its residents. How can we turn immigrants away when that was the guiding principle on which we were founded? It is immoral to vilify them and cruel to turn them away simply because they asked to come in.",1,1
"I believe cannabis should never be legalized because who wants high people everywhere around us? it is illegal for a reason, because being high is immoral and dangerous and what if they drive high? How can you measure that? There isn't even a test yet to measure that.",0,1
"I believe that life begins with conception. If that is true, abortion is murder. I could understand an abortion if the mother's life is in danger. I do not think mental anguish is a viable reason.",1,1
Euthanasia allows a country to weed out the weakest and most frail. Those that are a burden to society must be removed. We have allowed so much inbreeding that we have weaker races. We can't afford to take care of everyone forever.,0,0
It is immoral for two people of the same sex to marry. Marriage is for a man and a woman only. The Bible says that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Gays are breaking God's law.,0,0
I think that legal immigration is great. Illegal immigrants are criminals by definition. It is unfair to the people attempting legal immigration. We need the wall on the southern border.,1,1
"There is no evidence that cannabis is more dangerous than alcohol. I alcohol can be regulated, so can cannabis. The taxes raised could be put towards improving the education system. Government should not be in the morality regulating business.",0,1
"I'm against abortion in most cases. Like everything there are exceptions. If you are just too irresponsible and lazy to take precautions, I don't feel abortion is right in those instances. However, in situations such as rape, I am in favor of abortion because nobody should have to have reminders of that.",1,1
I am in favor of euthanasia. It's none of my business what other people want to do. Sometimes it's the best option. The ends justify the means sometimes.,0,1
I support gay marriage. Everyone should be able to marry whoever they want. Gay marriage should be celebrated. There should be no laws and everyone should be able to do as they wish.,0,1
"I think we are going to far in this country. I feel like there should be some laws, but building a wall is idiotic. There are always going to be people who find a way to cheat the system, but we have bigger problems. I think we are way to focused on this issue when there are bigger issues.",1,1
We have enough problems with drugs in this country without trying to make another one legal. Cannabis is a dangerous drug and should not be legalized. The advantages of legalizing it are not enough to justify it. It would cause more harm than good.,0,1
I dont believe is a something that should be attempted; other than when rape or incest is involved. If you are old enough to have sex than you should be aware of the consequences of unprotected sex. Those that do partake in an abortion is their business. But many people have kids in less than ideal of situations and the child and parent have been successful. Man up to the consequences or practice safe sex.,1,1
"People have the right to live or die. If someone wants to die, let them kill themselves. Their isnt a need of another waste to society. Approved doctors that are able to perform this and make a living. Good on them. SOmeone not wanting to suffer is their business.",0,1
Its completely wrong. Against natures law and what has been told of us in the bible. The idea of 2 men or 2 woman being together are disgusting. They choose what is not according to natures law. They all should be quarantined on a island so they dont spread their disease.,0,1
"Migrants are some of the hardest working people in the country. There should be a work visa that allows them into the country. They shouldnt be offered any government assistance. Like the majority of the working class. If they take jobs that nobody else are interested in then, there shouldnt be an issue. The idea that they all are bad or wrongdoers is prejudice and ignorance. Anyone that isnt native american is a migrants",1,0
"Dope is the root of all evil. Its the gateway drug into harsher drugs and death. Nobody needs it, this legalization card is a farce. Another way for people that cant cope with life can escape.",0,1
"I am Pro-Choice, and I think abortion should be legal. There are too many kids that are a ward of the state, so why make more if you arent ready, arent healthy, cant afford children, knowingly use drugs, and accidentally creating a human while not ready. I think abortion should be legal for any woman regardless. Her body, her choice.",1,1
"Animals should only be put down if they are dying or medically ill without treatment. Putting animals down ""just because"" it really damn stupid!",0,1
"I am LESBIAN and I am MARRIED, so i love gay marriage and it should be legal EVERYWHERE! People should be free to love whomever they want (man, woman, trans, etc,)",0,1
"I think migrants should be treated better, they are labeled and i hate that, almost as much as the stupid wall that trump wants. Migrants should have a little bit of freedom and the option to better the life for their family with extensive background and drug checks.",1,1
Canabis saves so many people everyday and I believe it should be completely legal all over the world. Weed is not a drug. It is an unaltered plant.,0,1
"Of course it should be legal. Everyone has an absolute right to decide what is attached to their body. The forced birth crowd doesn't care at all about life, only punishing people for having sex.",1,1
"God created all life/ That means that only god can end it. If we start killin people because we think they have outlived their usefulness, they might start killin us next. We have to stand up for gods law.",0,0
"Gay marriage is bad. I read some book about this god guy. God does not like gay people, so they must stopped.This would include their civil rights. If we make life hard for them, they will become straight.",0,0
Most of these people come here to have a better life. Most work hard and follow the rules. I much prefer working with migrants than entitled trumpanzees. Migrants have always been the backbone of American society. We should welcome them.,1,1
"If we legalize the devil's lettuce, then black people will start raping white women. I saw a film about this once. Perhaps most people can handle it, but it's not worth the risk to our women and society. It also make people lazy. The natural order of things says that we should work hard our entire lives.",0,1
I believe that abortions are unethical and a terrible thing but necessary. They should not be illegal because people should have the right to choose not to have a child. If a child were to come from 2 unwilling parents they would either have to endure the life of an unloved child and potentially abused by the parents or experience the life of an orphan that will likely experience many rejections and never have a normal life.,1,1
Euthanasia should not be legal because it takes away the life of an already living person.,0,1
Gay marriage is unnatural and threatening the sanctity of marriage. Marriage is not a symbol of love but rather a union of man and woman. Gay marriage undermines this.,0,0
"I believe, as the child of immigrants from Vietnam, that there should be a limit on how many people can come to the US from a certain country. This is because not all people can benefit the country and the people that try to enter may hurt citizens intentionally or unintentionally.",1,1
Cannabis should not be legal because it will take away business from pharmaceuticals and tobacco companies.,0,1
"Abortion is a Woman's choice. It is her body, therefore her choice. There are so many children in this world, and if a woman is not going to provide a loving and caring home, she should be able to get an abortion. I don't think it should be a method of birth control, and of course I think women should be responsible. I just think that it would be better for someone to abort, than bring a child into this world to lead a miserable life.",1,1
"Euthanasia is immoral. It is never the answer, and people suffering should pray about their conflicts. If the US made euthanasia legal, people would make decisions that are permanent. Ending their life is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.",0,1
"Gay marriage is wrong. The bible says that God condemns gay marriage. Man and woman were created for each other, and it should stay that way. It is the most natural way of doing things.",0,0
"I think that immigrants should be more accepted. I think it should be done legally of course. America can't possibly house everyone. I think that the US should help other countries have a stronger infrastructure so that people would want to live in their countries. I do think that the US should help immigrants, and treat them kindly.",1,1
Cannabis should not be legalized under any circumstances. It causes people to act in ways that they shouldn't. There would be so many more DUI's. People would think that it is okay to use cannabis during the work and school day. Society would be even further from God.,0,1
