"Abortion is murder. Life begins at conception, as the bible clearly states, and terminating that life is murder, a mortal sin. Unwanted children can be adopted out to families who cannot have children, if the birth mother doesn't want it.",0,1
I am in favor of assisted suicide in the case of people with intractable and terminal illnesses or for people with conditions leaving them in so much pain that their quality of life is diminished. I am not in favor of assisted suicide for mental disorders and I am cautiously in favor of euthanasia in the case of long-term comas or the like for which the odds of recovery are extremely low.,1,1
"I am completely in favor of gay marriage, and I think that the legalization of it in the United States took far too long. Marriage isn't a religious institution, not entirely, anymore. It's a civil matter and is a binding contract between two people (who usually love each other). The ""slippery slope"" argument many people use against gay marriage is spurious at best.",1,1
"Migrants are criminals, dealing in drugs, attacking women and children, and stealing jobs from hardworking blue collar Americans. We must adopt a strong anti-immigration policy, as we aren't even taking care of our own people - we should be taking care of the homeless and of vets first, not people who aren't even from our country.",0,1
"I am in favor of cannabis legalization for medical use and am ambivalent for recreational use. At the very least, I would want to see cannabis heavily taxed, were it to be made recreationally legal. I would also prefer that a ruling be made federally, as it is still illegal federally even as states legalize it.",1,1
"Abortion should be illegal everywhere in this world. Women should not have the right to terminate pregnancy. They should be forced to have a child, whether they are able to take care of it or not. Even in the case of rape, or underage women, they should be made to keep their pregnancy.",0,1
"People who are dying of a painful disease should be allowed euthanasia. They do not want to continue to be in unbearable pain, or be dependent on others. They should also have the right to die to not burden themselves or their families with huge medical bills for an illness that can not be cured. It should be monitored, but it should be legal.",1,1
"I have no problem with gay marriage. People are just people. And love is love. To find love in your life, regardless of the sex of your partner, is a gift. And all the legal benefits of being married to your partner should be allowed.",1,1
"Unless you are Native American, either you or or family is an immigrant. Everyone should have the right to come to the US and build a better life. Children of immigrants who are born here should be legal citizens automatically. Everyone should have the right to apply for citizenship here.",0,1
People should have the right to use cannabis if they desire. To own and grow their own as well. Cannabis has tremendous medical properties that are just beginning to be discovered. You can not die from smoking or using cannabis.,1,1
Abortion is a birth control option. It is fine. It should be legal. It should be accessible to all at any time.,0,1
Life is precious. Killing of any kind is murder. Euthanasia is murder.,1,1
Homosexuality is a sin according to the Bible. I believe the Bible and want to serve God so I oppose gay marriage. Marriage is between a man and a woman. Gay marriage is not really marriage.,1,1
We should allow any and all migrants in. They do not cause problems. They help the economy. They make the country better.,0,1
I have seen the results of cannabis use. It damages thinking and causes problems in families. I am opposed to legalizing it for recreational use. I do approve of it being legal for medical use.,1,1
"Abortion is immoral and is not the right of a person to decide. Forcing women to keep unwanted pregnancies will enhance their lives. There are no implications or downsides to taking away a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. We desperately need more people in the world, so this is another reason why every pregnancy no matter how dangerous to the mother should be maintained.",0,1
"Euthanasia has been practiced for animals for many years, and as difficult as it is to make the decision to end the life of a dear pet sometimes it is best. If an animal can no longer enjoy life or continue on without significant assistance then euthanasia might be appropriate. As for humans, I agree that people should have the right and ability to make a judgement for themselves about ending their own lives. People who are terminally ill, cannot exist without assistance of machines or have a very poor quality of life are a few of the examples I can think of as scenarios that could be considered.",1,1
"I believe that everyone has a right to a partner for life that they can rely on for love and support. A partnership that is legally binding in the eyes of the law is something that everyone deserves. This type of union provides stability in difficult times when a casual, unofficial, relationship may not be enough to prove a connection to another person. I am uncomfortable with using the word ""marriage"" and for couples to have weddings and other trappings of traditional marriages. Civil union and lawful partnerships would be more comfortable labels for me and perhaps for others to hear, see, and use in conversation rather than ""marriage"".",1,1
No migrants should be allowed in to any country that is not their native land. Migration should not even be an issue. All people should stay within the boundaries of the land/country in which they were born. There is no benefit to learning from other cultures or integrating dissimilar cultures together.,0,1
"I'm torn on the topic of cannabis legalization. Medical uses and similar uses that improve the quality of life for people and are controlled or monitored is appropriate. There are many people, young and old, that have benefited from access and use of this as medicine. Opening up the barn doors wide to use for all, everywhere, all the time, all at once could cause major problems. Unfortunately, many people cannot control themselves and abuse systems and opportunities that began with honorable intentions.",1,1
Abortion is wrong. No human should decide whether or not another human lives or dies. The person should at least carry the child and give them up for adoption. It is murder to abort a child.,0,1
"Euthanasia is humane. With the consent of the patient, it allows them to no longer be suffering. People will be miserable and waiting to die and deserve to be relieved from that. They deserve to not be tortured by their own bodies.",1,1
Gay marriage is essential and a basic human right. Those who love each other should be able to have the privilege of marriage. Gay people are no less human than heterosexuals and deserve to be treated as such. Their love is just as valid.,1,1
Migrants are taking over our population. We should have the country remain the same and allow less people into it. It would bring forth more crime. It would also take away jobs.,0,1
Cannabis legalization is a great idea. It has been proven to have medical benefits. There are no negative affects of marijuana and it should be up to the individual. It would be safer and better if it were sold legally and taxed.,1,1
"I consider myself to be pro-choice. I can not say that I would have an abortion, but I think that the choice is mine to make. I strongly believe that late term abortions should only be to save the life/health of the mother or if the unborn child is no longer viable. I do think that there are cases where abortion might be the answer for some women or girls. I believe a woman should have the right to have all options on the table and that the ultimate decision on what to do about a pregnancy should be hers.",1,1
"I don't believe that anyone has the right to ""play God"" under any circumstances. No matter what the situation, how much pain or suffering someone is going through, there is always hope. People should not be able to decide when they have suffered enough, that is not their decision. Death comes when it is supposed to and humans do not have the right to make that decision.",0,1
"I believe that gay marriage is completely wrong. It goes against all religious beliefs and it harms society as a whole. There is something completely unnatural and sinful about homosexuals and in no way should they be allowed the privilege of marriage. Marriage is only between one man and one woman, anything else not recognized in the eyes of God.",0,1
I think that we live in a nation that was formed by immigrants. America is known for welcoming people from all over the world. I believe that there are those that abuse the right to enter by doing so illegally and we as a country do need to find better ways to monitor those who wish to enter our country. I do not think the answer is to build a wall. I believe it is to provide more resources for those at the borders to screen those entering.,1,1
"It is my belief that everyone should be able to use cannabis for medical reasons, under the advice of a physician. No one should have to be in pain or suffer from debilitating symptoms if cannabis can help them. At this time, I am not prepared to say that cannabis should be legal. The argument that it is less harmful than alcohol may be true, but I do believe that it can cause decision impairment that might lead to more accidents or stupid behavior.",1,1
"Overall, I am not an advocate for abortion. It is not a moral action. However, there may be certain circumstances where abortion may have to be considered. If the mother's life is in danger is a prime example. I most cases, abortion should be a very, very last option for an unwanted pregnancy. Adoption should be the primary choice.",1,1
It should be done with abandon Anyone deemed too sick or too old should be euthanized. It is the way to go. The government should set up death panels.,0,1
It should never be allowed. It is amoral. It is not recommended according to the Bible. Marriage should only be between a non-gay man and a non-gay woman.,0,1
"The U.S. is open to all individuals who wish to become citizens, play by the rules, and contribute to society. For those that wish to enter the country illegally, and not follow the rules should not be accepted unless under the most extreme circumstances. Persons should not be permitted to enter illegally and take advantage of all that is available without contributing. You have to do your part to contribute and pay taxes and be a good member of society.",1,1
"It may be a good idea if it is thoroughly controlled like alcohol. While it is illegally to drive while intoxicated with alcohol,it should then be illegal to drive while intoxicated from the use of cannabis. It would have to be regulated and taxed by Federal and state governments. The public still needs to understand that just because it is legal does not me it should not be used with responsibility.",1,1
Abortion is not something I would do. Some do it and well they have to answer for their own actions not me.,1,1
Humans shouldn't be euthanized and either should animals. Who cares if they are suffering. We are all animals meant to suffer.,0,1
Gay marriage should not be allowed as it goes against humanity. I so do care what happens in another person's home. I am so invested that I want gay marriage banned.,0,1
We are a country founded on immigration so why now are we so worried when the vast majority just want a good like not to take over the world.,1,1
This is no worse than drinking daily and in fact I am not sure what the health effects are. We are still trying to figure that out. Is it more or less worse than drinking? Right now it is. And jails are overflowing so why bother with cannabis.,1,1
I do not believe in abortion. I do not believe in killing babies. I believe there are other choices that can be made. I believe in adoption over abortion.,1,1
I think euthanasia should be illegal. I think people should suffer. I believe in letting the sick die on their own. I think the sick like to be sick.,0,1
I think gays shouldn't marry. I think it should be against the law for gays to marry. I think being gay is gross. I dislike the thought of gay marriage.,0,1
I believe the migrants need to become citizens. I believe they should be charged when laws have been broken. I believe migrants should be given a fair chance to become a citizen. I believe we should focus more on making sure migrants get that fair chance.,1,1
I believe in legalizing cannabis. I believe in using cannabis for medical and personal use. I believe cannabis use is a positive thing. I believe in using cannabis as a way of making money.,1,1
"It is my opinion that a woman's body and health are to be tended to by the person that owns it; therefore, I believe that until a viable child is born and draws breath that it is not seperate from the mother. It has been a historical fact that women have been held back and financially repressed because they are sometimes forced to carry unwanted children to term. It is a fair and equal society that allows a woman to choose her own course in this matter.",1,1
"It is wrong to terminate any human life while breath is still being drawn, while hope remains for possible recovery; every day wonderful new advances are made in medicine that could mean cures for comas or seemingly ""incurable"" conditions. It is also against Holy law, regardless of your faith, since all organized religions say it wrong to take one's own life.",0,1
"There is an unnatural element to Gay marriage that weakens traditional unions. It violates both religious and natural law. It cannot be found as a natural occurrence among animals so it must be wrong for humans, too.",0,1
"America is a nation based on immigration, it is through the adding of diverse qualities and cultures that we are strengthened. As new groups come to the country they add their unique inclinations and styles, opening up new possibilities. The celebration of diversity is a practical means for a nation to grow wiser and stronger.",1,1
"Cannabis is a basically-harmless recreational drug that has so few side-effects that it is difficult to justify incarcerations for possession. Sales might be a bit different since there may be tax complications, but legal product brings in tax revenues to the government.",1,1
"I think abortion should be legal. Moreover, I do not think that any person other than a pregnant woman, in consultation with her doctor, should be able to say if she can, should, cannot, or should not have an abortion as long as the fetus is not viable outside the womb. I think abortion should be legal up until the point that a fetus is viable outside the womb, or later if the mother's life is at stake or at risk if she carries the fetus full term or close to full term. The decision a woman makes on whether she has an abortion should be made my her, in consultation with her doctor, and not dictated by political or religious reasons behind any legislation. This country was founded on the separation of church and state and, therefore, no religious beliefs should be a factor.",1,1
"I think that euthanasia should be illegal. Euthanasia is essentially just killing a person, even if it is done by a doctor. Murderers are put in jail, and sometimes even receive the death penalty, so euthanasia should be treated in a similar way. Human life is precious and ending a person's life through euthanasia, before it is their time to die, would be wrong.",0,1
"I think that gay marriage should not be legal. Gay marriage takes away from the tradition of marriage. Since gay couples cannot create their own families through natural ways, they should not be able to enter into a marriage, which is the beginning of a family. Religious scripture tells us that marriage is between a man and a woman and so there should not be other forms of marriage, such as gay marriage.",0,1
"I think migrants and migration is good. Having immigration promotes diversity and offers many opportunities for advancement, both of society and for the migrants themselves. Additionally, many, if not most migrants, migrate for the chance for better opportunities and in a safer environment than their home environment. There is nothing to fear about migrants or migration. Migrants are often willing to risk their lives to improve their situation and that would translate into the migrants working hard in their new society and trying their best to be a part of the society.",1,1
"I think cannabis should be legal. Cannabis should be legal because there have been proven medicinal benefits for its use. Moreover, legalizing cannabis would save money and generate money. Legalizing cannabis would save money because fewer cops would have to stop people for cannabis possession and then fewer people would be in jail for cannabis possession or dealing as well. Additionally, legalizing cannabis would generate money because it could be taxed at a similar rate as other ""sin taxes"" and that money could be used for a variety of different uses, such as education, infrastructure, or even healthcare. Lastly, legalizing cannabis would make cannabis safer for all who use it because there would be regulations regarding its growth and sale and no one would have to take the chance that their cannabis is laced with anything.",1,1
I believe Abortion should be legal. It is vital that women be provided the health care that they need regardless of whether or not they are carrying a fetus. If abortion was more readily available I believe there would actually be more to term pregnancies and healthier children being born. When women are forced to carry a pregnancy to term the risk usually outweigh the outcome.,1,1
"Euthanasia is downright wrong. It shouldn't be in any persons' hands to take a life, professional or not. The moment you start letting people decide to die legally is the moment you legalize suicide. Anyone with temporary problems will take permanent solutions and nothing good will come out of people being given the opportunity to take their own life regardless of if they had help or not.",0,1
Gay marriage is morally wrong. If you allowed gay people to get married there would be no real importance to actual marriage. It would be making a mockery of a sacred bond. Having gay marriage be legalized would definitely encourage more people to disgrace the union made in front of god and your family.,0,1
There are so many people whose family is made up of immigrants and we need a better policy for immigration. No child should be stripped from their parents. No family should be deported for wanting a better life full of opportunity. Instead we need to take a closer look at how we handle issues of immigration and how its often mislead by people and their irrational fears.,1,1
Cannabis should definitely be legalized. In every way it provides the relief that so many people seek from way more serious and dangerous substances. If cannabis were legal there would probably be a decrease in people becoming addicted to pain medication. It would also give a lot of people who were wrongfully imprisoned a second chance at life.,1,1
Abortion needs to stay legal to protect women's right to choose. It should not be up to the government to decide what women do with their bodies. The government wasn't there when they got pregnant. The government won't be there raising the child. The government should stay out of it.,1,1
This is terrible! God doesn't allow you to decide for yourself when you will die. It's up to him to make that decision. DOn't take those ideas in to your own head.,0,1
I think Gay marriage should be outlawed. It's a sin. No one should be able to marry the same sex. We will be marrying animals next!,0,1
"I think the Us needs to have a simpler process to allow migrants in legally. However, if you are illegal, you should have to face the consequences of breaking the law. If I break the law in another country, I get in trouble. Why not expect the same here.",1,1
I think it should be legal. Pot does not hurt anyone and we can tax it to get more money. People who smoke pot are pretty gel. Why isn't it legal?,1,1
"I beleive that abortion is killing. A mother should have the right to choose (between her and God). But, the government should put some limits on it (like not beyond a certain week). Failure to do this means that anything can go. Look at New York state. They just passed a law that allows a woman to abort a fetus up until birth. Babies are known to feel pain in the womb. And all babies have souls according to the Bible Abortion is killing, pure and simple. I also beleive in a woman's right to choose as long as it doesn't go against the law of the land. But, she will always go against the law of the Bible according to the Word of God.",1,1
"It is right for a person in extreme pain to be able to end their life if he or she so choices. Notions that suicide is wrong in this instance is wrongly looked at. No one can understand how the person who is in extreme pain feels. And if that person is going to die anyway, especially a long and slow death, who are we to deny them the release that they so need. The choice of the person involved must be done when he or she is only in a right mental state. And a doctor should be present to make sure that things go the right way. Laws should not encourage or discourage this choice. The choice of euthanasia is up to the person and perhaps their family. If we can do this to family pets, why can't a human being choose this for themselves?",0,1
"I believe that gay persons should allowed to be married. What not? If straight people can get married, why should gay persons be denied the same rights? The US was founded on the prinicipal that all persons were created equal and should have equal access to the same things. Old-fashined notions from the Bible are just that-old-fashioned. We need to recognize the love between people doesn't necessarily fit any particular mold and that same sex marriage affords the same stability that traditional marraige does for the children involved. We must take this movement to the streets and also to the halls of Congress for us to be heard.",0,1
"I believe that immigrants should be allowed in this country. However, there has to be some limits on immigration due to the increases bombing as of late and due to the activties of some groups such as Al Queda. All immigrants must go through proper channels and come into this country as the law states. There are policies in place for real aslyum cases-which are rarer than people just looking for a better life because conditions in their home country just are not to their liking. Texas recently stated that it had around 60,000 people vote illegally which were illegal immigrants. The legal citizens of this nation have a right to see that immigrants come threw proper channels and are vetted.",1,1
"I believe in legalization of Cannabis for medical reasons only. Allowing Cannabis for recretational purposes will just increase the likelihood of people getting behind the wheel of a car and having a wreck. Cannabis can also lead someone to try harder drugs such as opiods or crack. The bible says to be sober in all things. I think that our God knows best, don't you? However, God did create marijuana for a reason and I beleive that that reason was to allow people to have a plant that would relieve their symptoms if those persons had certain diseases for which marijuana was made to relieve those symptoms. Even animals have eat it when they were sick for some reason unknown to us.",1,1
"Abortion is not an easy subject for anyone to deal with, especially a woman considering having one. I think that women should legally be able to have an abortion within the first 3 months of pregnancy, under a doctor's care. I think most women considering the procedure do not take the decision lightly and would have the procedure under trying circumstances.",1,1
"People should not have the legal right to die, or euthanasia. It is still murder, or assisted suicide, and therefore should remain illegal.",0,1
Gay marriage should not be legal. Our nation was founded on principles in the Bible and the Bible does not support marriage between persons of the same sex. None of the founding fathers were known to be gay or homosexual; therefore gay marriage runs counter to what this nation has meant since its beginning.,0,1
"Migrants or immigrants should continue to be allowed to come to the US in pursuit of legal immigration. The US has been a melting pot of nationalities and cultures since its inception, and no irrational fear of foreigners should change this.",1,1
Cannabis should continue to become legal in all states across the US. Use of cannabis is somewhat comparable to use of alcohol; it should be regulated in some fashion as alcohol is. Use of cannabis does not necessarily lead to use of stronger and more potent drugs.,1,1
"Abortion should be legal for protection of the mother, in cases of rape and incest, and for nonviable fetuses, but not for 'convenience'",1,1
Inferior people should be euthanized. There is no place for them in society,0,0
"Gay marriage is a great thing, Gays are just as entitled to marriage benefits as anyone else. In fact if I want to marry my horse, I should be respected and revered for it.",0,1
"Legal Immigration is wonderful, but ILLEGAL immigration hurts everyone. Illegals should be sent back immediately",1,0
"Cannabis is bad for the health, worse than tobacco. It should be banned. In fact it's already banned by Federal law so why are the feds not prosecuting/",1,1
I think abortion is one of the worst things on earth. I believe women should keep the baby even if they got raped. I think its a complete sin even if it was just fertilized. I believe the baby should be kept no matter what.,1,1
I think its right to do this. I think you should do it regardless. I believe it would help if someone is suffering. I think it's an okay option.,0,1
I think gay marriage is wrong. I don't think people should do that. I believe its a sin. I don't think it should be okay under any circumstance.,0,1
I don't think anyone should be allowed to come in the country. I think it belongs just to americans. I don't think it matters how hard working they maybe. I just generally believe they don't belong here.,1,1
I don't think cannabis is safe. I feel like a person can overdose on it. I don't believe it should be legalized. I feel like its a pointless substance.,1,1
"I believe that abortion is a legal medical procedure that is no different from other medical procedures. Women should be able to get abortions as it is not only their personal reproductive right, but their health could be negatively affected from the fetus.  The woman's life takes precedence over unborn/underdeveloped life that has not fully developed into a human life. In cases of severe disability of the fetus or rape-induced pregnancy, abortion should be an option for the woman. Abortion must be protected by laws to reduce stigma and discrimination by those who wish to inflict their own beliefs on everyone around them, instead of allowing for diversity of opinion and action.",1,1
"Euthanasia is a good alternative to those in extreme pain and who cannot be helped by medicine. If an individual wants to die, they should be allowed to. Suicide is not illegal. Let those with life-ending diseases or circumstances continue to make their own decisions. Euthanasia can be a valid option for people to die with dignity and rapidity.",0,1
"Gay marriage is a travesty to the original concept of marriage and should not be legalized, as marriage has been legally stated being between opposite genders for a long time. Gay marriage is nothing more than an attempt to grab benefits of heterosexual marriage benefits, from insurance to disability payouts. Gay marriage has a negative effect on the country's moral standing, as we should all be Christians who strive for godly behavior. The Bible, which should be the country's fallback, states that being gay is a sin, much like adultery or divorce. We should outlaw these things!",0,1
"Migrants should be allowed into the countries they are attempting to gain access to on the basis of asylum. Migrants are often beneficial for a host country's economy, and should be welcomed as such. To discriminate against migrants is to be hypocritical about your own heritage, as all humans have at one point migrated to their current position. Blaming migrants for woes in society is an ineffective form of victim-blaming that accomplishes nothing.",1,1
"I do not believe that cannabis/marijuana should be legalized, for multiple societal and health reasons including a lack of experiments and studies on its effects. I believe that those who regularly consume cannabis are less motivated and successful than others, and have a hard time making goals. I am fine with laws changing to the effect of lower possession requirements for imprisonment, so that those in poverty are not overly punished for carrying marijuana, but I disagree with recreational legalization. Cannabis should not be legalized until studies can prove it has positive effects on a person's health and societal contributions.",1,1
Abortion on demand whould be available to all. We should not question the age of the female who requests an abortion. Fetal tissues and parts should be sold following abortions. Abortion providers are wonderful people.,0,1
"This is an issue that I have considered often.  I've had to make the decision to euthanize dogs inthe past, and that still tears at my soul. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be to make that decision for a human being. Having said that, there is a point at which you cannot allow the suffering to continue, but I think it would be awful.",1,1
"I do not have any problem with gay marriage.  Falling in love is a wonderful thing, and I cannot imagine being told by society that I was not allowed to marry the person I loved above all others. I do get frustrated by people who get militant about forcing others to accept gay marriage. I believe that some people have very deeply held religious belief that make it impossible for them to use the words gay and marriage together.",1,1
"We should have completely open borders, with out Border Patrol agents. Anyone who wants to come to America should be welcomed. Recruiting posters should be put up in all foreign border town advising residents of all of the freebies they can get here. Migrants should be giving a voter registration card as soon as they set foot on American soil.",0,1
Cannabis is a wonderful drug. It should be legal in all 50 states. Anybody currently in prison for cannabis related crimes should be freed immediately. The federal goverment should decriminalize it on the Federal level.,0,1
"I believe that a woman should be able to get a safe, legal abortion if she so chooses. A woman has the right to make decisions about things that affect her body. I think the topic of abortion has become more an issue of religion in this country and no longer has anything to do with the safety or health of mother or child. We need to take religion out of the argument for or against abortion.",0,1
I believe that a person should have the individual right to end their life. I do not think that anyone should get to decide whether someone should be euthanised. We put animals down if they are suffering and have no quality of life so why shouldn't we do the same with humans. Euthanasia is a hotly contested issue in this country.,1,1
"I feel that gay marriage should be legal everywhere. As a lesbian, I strongly believe that the LGBTQ communities should have the same rights as the rest of the population because there is nothing different about their relationships. The issue of gay marriage needs to stop being an issue in the United States because there are a lot more pressing problems this country is facing that need to be dealt with. Gays deserve the same protections that straight people enjoy.",1,1
I think our policy in the United States on migrants should definitely be looked at. I think there is a legal way to enter this country that must be followed and that we do need strict background checks on people wanting to enter the country. I also think that there are many reasons people would come here seeking asylum and we should want to help these people. Our country is a country of immigrants and I think we have forgotten about all of that as the country grows more divided.,0,1
I definitely think that cannabis should be legalized. States can make a lot of money off of legal cannabis sales that could be put towards education or public safety. Cannabis is not a dangerous drug and has many health benefits that could improve the quality of life for many people. Legalizing cannabis would also keep people safer by keeping them out of high crime neighborhoods where they may have normally gone to purchase cannabis.,0,1
Abortion is killing of an unborn child. It should never be allowed under any circumstances because life starts at conception. It should be banned and no government money should be used to support it. The child's heartbeat starts at 6 weeks - how can this not be considered a living human being? This is clearly a human and should not be allowed to be murdered.,0,1
"People who have terminal illnesses should be allowed to choose their own time of passing. I do not think that people with mere depression should be allowed to do that, because they can be helped and depression is often temporary. I know someone who was dying of cancer and he shot himself before it got too awful because it was an easier and faster way to go. He did it after visiting his friends and making his goodbyes. Being able to have a more peaceful death and less messy would be better and we should not force people to suffer. It needs to be clear though and not forced on others.",1,1
"I think that any two people who are in love should be allowed to get married. We should not judge people on who they love and we should not restrict marriage by religion. If a religion does not want to allow it that is fine, but the government and taxes and all sorts of things should not be determined by religion. People are not bad just because they happen to love someone of the same sex. Your sexuality is determined by genetics and should not be discriminated against by government.",1,1
We need to police our borders. Migrants are coming in by the thousands and are committing crimes and living off of the welfare state. They are taking jobs and money from us. We need to send them back to where they came from and not keep them here. This country cannot afford to have tens of millions of illegals taking jobs and money from hard working americans.,0,1
Pot should not be legalized. It is a dangerous drug and is the gateway drug to many worse drugs. Pot heads are lazy and do not want to work. They also are not safe to drive and many jobs cannot afford to have stoned people doing them. We need to keep this drug illegal so that we can keep Americans safe. It is a dangerous substance. All drugs need to be illegal in this country and we need to block the border and keep them from coming in. Users should be locked up and given treatment so that they can stop using these drugs.,0,1
"Abortion is a crime that should not be permitted. Human lives need to be protected, even if the person causing harm is the mother. Humans should not be permitted to make the decision to kill someone else, when that individual has not committed a crime, is not in pain, and has not been given a moment to defend themself against the murderous crime of abortion.",0,1
"At times there is no guaranteed medical treatment to severely suffering events or illnesses. In that case, and with the consent of the patient, medical professionals should be able to do euthanasia. As a similar decision to coma or non-responsive patients, or DNR cases, individuals should retain control and decision-making over their own life. In the case that there is a potential solution to the pain, I return you to the case of DNR that permits someone to die even if extreme measures could prove life-saving.",1,1
"Gay marriage is an acceptable practice. Marriage is purely a construct to encourage adherence to social structures. It offers incentives about family structure, finances, and permission to make decisions and protections for another person. Regardless of the gender dynamics, two individuals that are not related and unable to get preferences that way, should be able to enter into such a contract. To deny them that right as gay marriage is to show gender discrimination.",1,1
"Migrants should systematically be removed from the country, as they use up substantial tax dollars without contributing to the US tax cycle themselves. Incoming migrants should be held at the border and forced to go through the same long and arduous role of requesting entry that migrants before them have committed to. It is not a fault of the nation if fewer migrants are admitted now, than before when it was primarily European migrants. The reason for that is simply that our country is more full and cannot sustain immigration at the rate it could when this country was founded.",0,1
"Cannibis offers a lot of risks to health and public safety, at a higher risk than alcohol. It should not be legalized because we cannot control the distribution. Similar to tobacco, cannis can be deadly as an inhalant, and individuals cannot be trusted to regulate themselves out in public or behind the wheel if rampant marijuana use was permitted. This country should not be contributing to, or encouraging, the growth of illegal substances.",0,1
This is illegal. Terrible. I do not believe any human should be put to death. This is not the right of the carrier.,0,1
"This must be the decision of those close to the patient. If there is any hope, then this is unacceptable. If the patient is suffering and can not be cured this is okay. This is a last resort.",1,1
I believe this is completely acceptable. It's completely fine to get married to whomever you like You have the right to decide on a gender. Its noones decision but your own.,1,1
They should come to the country. Migrants are important for diversity in our country. They need a place to stay and we should provide for them. i am in favor of migrants.,0,1
Cannabis should not be legalized. It is a huge distraction and makes people lazy. It also makes people anxious and addicted. Not a good thing.,0,1
"I believe that women who face an unwanted pregnancy should have the right to decide whether or not to keep the soon to be infant. The heartbeat of the infant doesn't start until 10wks gestation, so essentially the woman would be just aborting a fertilized egg.",0,1
I believe that people of sound mind with a terminal illness should have the right to self-terminate. Not everyone has to suffer to live a fulfilling life. I also believe the humane euthanasia of animals is both moral and ethical.,1,1
"A romantic, committed, adult relationship between two people is my definition of a marriage. Whether or not the couple is of the same sex is inconsequential and not important in the big picture. Therefore, same sex couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couple.",1,1
"All migrants should stay in their own country and apply for citizenship before entering the U.S. Application should be free, but migrants should pass a test that they have to purchase in order to become a citizen of the U.S.",0,1
I think we should continue with the policy of cannabis of being illegal. There have been many studies performed about how the use of cannabis by children/teens slows the growth of the brain. Legalizing cannabis will contribute to a population of lower intelligence.,0,1
"Abortion should never be legal, for any reason. Babies have life from very early on in the womb, and for that reason, they should not be killed. A baby doesn't have the ability to choose to live or to fight for itself and its right to live, so others have to fight for those unborn children. It is not right to kill anyone, for any reason, and that includes unborn children.",0,1
"I understand the desire of some people to want to be able to choose to end their lives how and when they choose, if they have some sort of debilitating, life-long disease that they will not be able to be cured of. I would ask that these people consult with a number of resources to ensure that nothing can be done to give the patient more comfort or improvement from his or her disease. I would also want the patient to meet with a psychologist to ensure that there are no underlying mental problems outside of the impact of the disease that are a part of the patient's decision. Given these factors, if the patient chooses to end his or her life rather than live with their disease, I would like to see the creation of organizations that would help the patient and his or her family through the process so that no family member has to be burdened with ending the life of a loved one.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage should be allowed in all states and countries. People love who they love, and they should not be judged or excluded because the person they love is the same gender as they are. As long as a relationship is consensual and respectful of both parties, no one outside of the relationship should have any right to stop the people from people in a relationship. Churches should be allowed to deny marrying gay couples based on the belief system of that church, but they need to do so respectfully. All other businesses should be asked to respect all relationships, but should also be allowed to deny service if it goes against the beliefs of the company overall. Such decisions, however, must be made publicly known, and must be done in a respectful manner.",1,1
"We shouldn't be letting so many migrants into this country. They don't know the American way, and therefore they threaten our culture and traditions. This country has a long, proud history, and it shouldn't be changed by outsiders. We also have to worry about the crime and danger that these new people would bring into our countries. We can't risk these criminals coming into our country and hurting our people.",0,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized. It is a dangerous drug that can be very addictive, and we don't want that drug to be easily in the hands of our citizens. Legalizing cannabis will also lead to more cases of people driving under the influence, and that will only make our roads more unsafe. We need to protect our citizens from addiction, car accidents, and other bad impacts that will come if more people are able to use cannabis.",0,1
"Abortion is the right of the mother, if she wants to kill her child then she has a right to do so. The father should have no say so in the killing of his child. A women should be allowed to kill as many children as she sees fit.",0,1
"I guess I would say it should be up to the patient. If the patient is for sure going to die, maybe it should be up to them if they get to die a painless death. If it is for sure going to be a pain full death, the patient should be allowed to die with their dignity.",1,1
"I believe Marriage is between a man and a women. Marriage is a religions ceremony. If a gay couple would like to have a civic ceremony, then that is up to them, but I would prefer it not to be called marriage. In the Bible Marriage is between a man and a women. This is just my opinion and I certainly would never force my opinion on anyone else.",1,1
The US can afford to pay for as many migrants as possible. We should open the borders with out any inspection or screening. We should give them all free health care and let them all get on our welfare system. The US citizen will pay for it all in our taxes.,0,1
Cannabis should be legalized everywhere in the united states. If people want to drive around high or take care of there children high it should be their right to do so. The government should have no regulations on legalizing Cannabis that way kids can get high too.,0,1
"Abortion should not be allowed because sex should only ever occur for the reason of procreation. Everyone should remain abstinent until they are planning to have a baby. After you have a baby, you should return to abstinence. Abortion could be allowed for medical emergencies, since the mother cannot make more babies if she dies in pregnancy.",0,1
"Euthanasia is a very complex topic. If you're in pain and dying, it seems right to be able to go out on your own terms and in a less painful way. But it's such a serious matter since it's a decision with no possibility of reversal. If someone is coerced into euthanasia, or isn't 100% sure about it, there is no fixing it. I'm not sure of where I stand on the issue because of the possibility of abuse. It does seem like you should have the right to decide your fate.",1,1
Gay marriage is a human right. LGBT people deserve the same rights as heterosexual people. Same-sex marriage is an important step for equality and should be legal everywhere. I 100% support same-sex marriage.,1,1
We should have completely open borders. So should every country in the world. People should be able to migrate freely wherever and whenever they want. Borders are not natural and go against the way our ancestors live. We should keep every country completely open for all.,0,1
Cannabis should be outlawed because it is morally wrong. Cannabis is not something good people partake in and therefore should not be legal. Cannabis consumption goes against biblical teachings and is a sin. The legalization of cannabis is a morally bankrupt position.,0,1
"A life is a life. Like Dr. Seuss said, a person's a person, no matter how small. You shouldn't have sex if you aren't ready for the consequences. You're just being selfish if you don't want to help usher in the LIFE that you created. Abortion is murder, plain and simple. Nobody asks to be born, and it's a terrible waste to kill a baby like that. They could be the next president, the person who finds the cure for cancer...life is sacred. Abortion is wrong.",0,1
"If you are terminally ill and suffering, it should be up to you to decide whether you want to carry on the suffering or embrace death. I think it's selfish to want to keep a suffering terminally ill person alive just so you can still spend time with them. I understand wanting to keep someone alive, but people shouldn't be forced to suffer if they're ready to die. However, this only applies in cases of terminal illness. If someone has a disease that can be cured, whether it be a physical or mental illness, all paths should be taken to try to alleviate the problem instead of turning to death. I understand this is sort of conflicting, but I think people should only have the choice to give up if they're just going to die anyway.",1,1
"I believe people should be allowed to marry whoever they want. There are certain rights marriages grant that aren't granted by other types of partnerships. Anyone who is truly in love should be able to enjoy the rights of marriage. The arguments that say it's a slippery slope to allowing marriage to animals are completely wrong. If you're a human being, you're born with the dignity of marrying who you want to. Love is love.",1,1
"I'm an American citizen and I work hard for my money - and half of that money is taken out of my paycheck for taxes! Which then go to illegals, who don't even contribute to the government that's helping them. They're all poor criminals who are making things worse in this country. I especially hate how none of them can speak English. If you move here, then assimilate! We need a border wall right now. I think anyone who even attempts to cross the border should be shot. In America, we have certain values, and you can't begin to appreciate them until you're a citizen yourself. If an illegal is found, they should be deported immediately.",0,1
"Marijuana is more dangerous than we give it credit for, just like alcohol. Alcohol is legal and we see addicts everywhere. How will marijuana be any different? Legalizing it will just make it easier for kids to get marijuana and they'll be hooked early on for life. People forget that smoking marijuana is about as bad as smoking anything else - there's still tar being produced that ends up in your lungs. People say that marijuana helps with cancer, but I think we'll find out in a few years that it's a huge carcinogen. Marijuana is also still federally illegal, so even being around it in a ""legal"" state puts you at risk of prison time. Marijuana is just not worth it.",0,1
"Abortion is a good option as it lets women have control of their own bodies. A baby that would have been aborted let to stay to full term would have been neglected and poorly parented anyway, so this is a mercy to the child. Not to mention the fact that there's rape and incest, and having to force a mother to care for a child like that is horrible. Also it's not even a real person until it's born anyway.",0,1
"I don't have a problem with someone who wants to die being able to get it medically done for them. The risks of a botched suicide is much much worse for the individual as it can leave them with permanent and horrific damage. If someone truly wishes to die, I believe it should be their right to make that choice, and that way they can settle things with all loved ones before and have a final good bye. I also think it would be easier on the families knowing that it's going to happen like this rather than walking in on a dead loved one.",1,1
"I find gay marriage to be morally and fundamentally wrong. While I don't mind gay couples, I do have a problem with the actual title of marriage and everything it represents. I find that also granting them the tax breaks of a married couple is ridiculous at best as those tax breaks are to incentivize the building of a family, aka pregnancy and offspring. Not to mention the religious and sanctity of marriage being between men and women.",1,1
"I don't think there should be open borders. Migrants should be able to come and go to wherever they want, it's the best way for job growth and city growth that way. You don't have to worry about competing governments or any of that as people would be able to migrate wherever they wish. Also to state that people own plots of dirt is silly, it's just land, we can share it.",0,1
"Cannabis should never be legalized, as alcohol is already bad enough. The dangers of weed involve lung cancer, throat, and mouth cancer. Not to mention schools are already having a horrible time keeping weed out of their classrooms and hallways, having more of it will create an even bigger problem to try to manage. Also the smell of it is absolutely disgusting, and soaks into everything, and is even harder to get out than cigarette smell.",0,1
"This should not be allowed as every life is precious. Even if it means the poverty cycle continues and the poverty line increases. Go forth and multiply, as stated in the Bible. Have as many kids as possible, do not undergo family planning as well. Abortion should be illegal. Everyone practicing this should be prosecuted.",0,1
"As long as a waiver is signed before the patient is unable to make a decision on their own, then it is acceptable. But what if they are unable to make a decision before a waiver is signed - next of kin, or immediate family such as a spouse should be able to make a decision on their loved one's behalf. However before they can make a decision, their background should be investigated first. We never know this might be a plan all along for something more deeper.",1,1
"I am complete okay with this. I am a Catholic, but not a ""very religious"". I just believe that if they're happy with that, then allow it. I believe that while this may be against certain religions, times have indeed changed and while certain religions have been keeping to a certain stance for a while, there's no reason NOT to change these values. Stances have been made before, new ones can certainly be made and old ones can be changed.",1,1
"Migrants should be stricter to get inside the country. Stricter laws, and perhaps they can only enter certain states and bar the rest from entering the ""real America"". Build the wall, make an example for other countries to follow. Other countries will then see the greatness of the wall and follow suit.",0,1
"Cannabis should be legal! Let everyone get their hands on cannabis, including minors. YOLO, as most people say. Let them live their lives as they see fit. Years down the line people will complain regarding this and we'll just say ""we told you so"".",0,1
"Abortion can never be ok because a life is a life. Life starts at fertilization. God creates all life and we shouldn't interfere with his plan. Abortion is murder, plain and simple.",0,1
"This can get tricky, because there could definitely be a slippery-slope. However, at its heart I believe that euthanasia is something that is done out of compassion and love. We want to help our loved ones to avoid suffering, and maintain their dignity. I would want my family to feel comfortable helping me to go out of this world in comfort and without becoming a burden or suffering.",1,1
"I think that since we have a separation of church and state, gay marriage should be legal, regardless of religious beliefs/viewpoints. I don't believe that people choose to be gay. They should have the ability to share the same rights to marry their love, as do others who marry heterosexually. I don't feel that gay marriage poses a threat to the sanctity of marriage. Heterosexual marriage poses just as many ""threats"", if that is going to be a consideration.",1,1
"Migrants should never be allowed to be here unless they go through the proper channels. Plenty of people wait for a long time and pay a lot of money to be granted citizenship; it isn't fair that some people just come in whenever they want. Policy needs to address the migrants that are here and deport them all. There is no need for migrants, they take our jobs and don't help our economy.",0,1
"Cannabis should never be legalized. It is just as bad as other drugs like meth. It also leads to increased drug use. There are no good benefits of cannabis. Alcohol is a legal drug, and see how much trouble comes from people who drink.",0,1
"Abortion should be legalized everywhere, in every situation, and here is why. Women need to have the freedom that they deserve and not be tied down to unwanted and unloved children. Allowing women to get abortions is a case of women's rights. Men get to go around an do whatever they want, to whoever they want, and they don't have to pay the consequences for any of it. Why should it be fair that men can do this while women who practice the same things and have the same ideas can be punished with an unwanted pregnancy. It isn't right! Women should be able to choose.",0,1
"Euthanasia should be illegal in all cases. The practice of injecting people with drugs to help ""relieve their suffering"" is murder! People strongly look down on suicide today, but in my opinion euthanasia is worse. People that commit suicide usually suffer from depression or other very real mental disorders while people who are euthanized are usually completely in their right mind. To me, this way of thinking is just wrong. Euthanasia is basically just committing suicide while being completely coherent and in your right mind. People will pass away when they are supposed to pass away.",1,1
"I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. This is how it has been since the beginning on time. There is data that shows the harmful affects on a child when they only have one gender of parents. Children need both a mom and a dad to raise them in an environment of love and caring. There is reason that the law has only allowed gays to marry for the past few years. This is unnatural. Think about it, if gays or lesbians want to have children, they have to go to an outside donor in order to complete this task. Obviously this is not natural and not the way that it should be.",1,1
"Isn't America the melting pot? Isn't America the richest country in the world? Why should we be able to keep people out of our great country just because they happened to be born in a different, less fortunate country. Wasn't America founded on the difference of opinions and migrants fleeing their country? As Americans, we should be more willing to let individuals, regardless of their race or nationality into our country. There are a ton of examples of migrants doing good things and working harder than we Americans will. I believe they should be rewarded for this and be allowed to stay in our great country.",0,1
"Marijuana should be legalized across the board. Here are a few reasons why. First of all, there are individuals who could be in so much less pain if medical cannabis would be legalized. I've heard stories of people who have been in excruciating pain and decide to use cannabis as a last resort. The results of these stories are incredible. I also think that it should be legalized because this would stop a lot of delinquents getting records. We all know that it is available if you know the right people to talk to. If Cannabis were to be legal, people wouldn't have to sneak around with it and drug cartels would go out of business pretty fast.",0,1
"Abortion is murder. It is killing a living organism that would thrive it wasn't ripped away from it's host. Therefore killing an organism, that is human is considered murder if it is left to thrive for 10 months.",0,1

Gay marriage is against the bible. God created Adam and Eve not Adam and STEVE.,0,1

"Personally, I could never follow through with an abortion. I know way too much about the way it is done and the consequences there are to the unborn child and the mother's health. However, I do believe that in specific situations, a mother should be allowed to have an abortion. I do believe there should be a limit on how late an abortion should be performed, and should never be done in the third trimester.",1,1
"Doctors are meant to do everything in their power to SAVE lives. The utter thought of euthanasia is a disgusting notion; to allow a doctor to purposely kill their patient?! It is barbaric, and should not ever be allowed, or even be considered as a legal option. God gave us this one life and body, and to dis-respect our greatest gift, is deplorable.",0,1
"The bible makes it very clear, throughout the text, that a marriage is a union between a man and a woman. Being devoutly religious, I cannot go against the word of God our Savior, and claim to be accepting of homosexual marriages. As a nation founded on the principles of Christianity, we cannot allow everything we were built on to be thrown away, to simply allow a few gays the right to marriage.",0,1
"America is a country full of opportunities and diversity. I understand why our neighbors to the south want to flock here for a better chance at life. However, I wouldn't expect myself to be able to just enter another country illegally and live there receiving all the benefits the country has to offer...without having done my proper due diligence and necessary legal prep-work. Therefore, I do believe there should be strict rules about how and when you can enter the United States, but perhaps we could make the process a bit more simplified so it is easier attained.",1,1
"There is far too many unknowns in the world of cannabis, cannabinoids, THC, etc to allow the legalization of the substance. If the government decided to legalize it, they would have to test the thousands and thousands of strains that potheads all over the world have mass produced, without a thought to their repercussions. It would take decades of studies, clinical trials, reports, etc. And for what...a bunch of people to get high? It's idiotic.",0,1

Policy on migrants should be in accordance to the law. They are people who should be treated as people (not kept and separated from families).,1,1
"I'm very proud that cannabis now legalized. People , especially young generation could enjoy everything!",0,1
"I think there are very valid reasons for abortion to be available to the public. In an ideal world, it would be the combined agreement between a man and a women regarding whether or not to have an abortion. When this isn't possible though, it is ultimately a question focusing on a woman's body and her decision on whether or not to keep a fetus. I should also note that I don't support to use of abortions as an all-around safety-net for unplanned pregnancies (i.e. the individual who chronically and willingly has unprotected sex). With regards to the religious opinions on abortion: Get your rosaries off my ovaries. My body, my choice.",1,1
"I don't think it's right to kill people. We were put on this Earth to live. It's not our place to take life away. We should not have a say on whether someone should die, even if they want to.",0,1
Gay marriage is unnatural. Marriage is for making babies and two men or two women can't do that. So it's wrong and shouldn't happen. Something is wrong with those people.,0,1
I think this topic is laughable considering our country was founded on immigration. We are the melting pot. The hub of immigration. Where the American dream is to achieve anything as long as you work hard. To ban or limit migrants would be to deny our country's history.,1,1
The devil's lettuce! What a horrible drug. It's a gateway to other awful things and the people using it are no good. It scares me.,0,1
Abortion is murder. To kill an unborn child is a cruel heartless thing to do. It should come with a punishment. This ultimately will also scare a person for life.,1,1

Gay marriage is a wonderful provision that states make available to those who love each other. Let them express their love for each other.,0,1

"I do believe that life begins at the time of conception. The zygote/embryo is eating, growing, and that is the very definition of life. I also think that, in certain situations, the line of morality can become a bit more grey. This would include situations involving rape.",1,1
"I think that every person has the right to decide when they want to die. If someone is dealing with a difficult disease or just can't see any light in their lives, they should have the option of a legal, safe way out of their situation. What do we have control of, if not our own lives?",0,1
"Gay marriage should not have been legalized, as it is a mockery of the sanctity of marriage. Marriage was made to include a man and a woman, as they are complimentary and part of a healthy family. Promoting gay marriage will promote the spread of disease and allow the future children of the United States to be raised without knowledge of good and evil.",0,1
"I think that the issue of illegal immigration is being blown out of proportion. I do think that these people should be legally bound to becoming US citizens within a certain time period, but I also don't believe that it is as severe of an issue as some think. Building a wall to keep out illegal immigrants, for example, seems a bit dramatic for the issue at hand.",1,1
"I do not think cannabis should become a legalized entity in our country. It will only promote the spread of other drugs, as it is a gateway drug for many individuals.

Not to mention, their ability to raise children, perform well at work, and make sound judgment decisions in public.",0,1
Every child is a special from the moment of creation in the mother's womb to natural death.  We need to protect every human life.

Who would ever smoke the devil's lettuce? Just the thought of legalizing pot should be illegal.,0,1
"Abortion should absolutely remain legal, and those that do not agree with it do not need to get one. What happens to a women's body is her choice, and a ""baby"" cannot survive with just a heartbeat alone. There are too many children in the foster and adoption systems, and not everyone has the means to care for a child or go through legal processes to give up the child. There are far too many religious zealots trying to take away these rights from women, based on the misogyny that is integrated into their holy texts.",1,1
"Euthanasia should not be legal, regardless of how deeply a person is suffering.

"Gay marriage is disgusting and marriage is a holy institution that should be between one man and one woman. The bible says that it is an abomination and I agree with that. LGBT people should be put to death for their crimes, even if they cannot control how they feel, or should be forced to convert to heterosexuality. The government poses this on us so gays can get tax exemptions.",0,1
"There needs to be some form of regulation, but vilifying people who come here searching for a better life is disgusting, racist and just shows a lack of empathy. I don't have the answers on this, but I think a border wall, for example, is a big waste of taxpayer money. Children should not be separated from their parents as they come across as it creates severely altered mental states in the child and poses psychological problems. Right now, the crisis at the border is reminiscent of early stages of Nazi Germany.",1,1
"Marijuana is the devil's lettuce. It is a gateway drug and indefinitely harmful to those who take it. Marijuana is possibly even more dangerous than alcohol. It should remain a Schedule I drug, and the government should enforce this to the greatest extent of the law, including lengthy jail time for possession.",0,1
"Women should have the right to choose whether or not they want an abortion. Abortions should be legal within a certain time range. Just because I feel this way does not mean I am PROABORTION.

"Euthanasia is just another word for murder and suicide. When people are terminally ill and suffering, they are not thinking straight.

If someone dying truly wants it than it is ok. there must be strict guidelines for it to be done.,0,1
it is so wrong! only a man and a woman should marry!,0,1
I think we can't ban all people from our country. People will find other ways to get in. It is better to work with people trying to come here.,1,1
It would be better regulated if it was legal even though I personally don't have a need for it.,0,1
"I believe women should have a choice if they are to have a baby. However, I do think the father has a right to weigh in on the decision. If someone is irresponsible and gets pregnant, they should have to deal with the consequences, so I think the father should also be allowed to influence the decision of if the baby will or won't be aborted, and if either party disagree with the abortion, then the baby should be born and given to the parent who wants the child. I do not think an abortion should be allowed past the 2nd half of the 2nd trimester.",1,1
"It is not our place to determine if someone is to live or die. We cannot allow someone to kill themselves either, it is a sin and cannot be condoned. If we allow those in a great deal of physical pain pass peacefully, why not those dealing with mental pain. It will legalize and promote suicide.",0,1
"Gay marriage is a detriment to the notion of marriage. It makes real marriages, those between men and women, look like shams and decrease their value. The gays should not be allowed to marry because it will drain our resources and breed more gay people. They are bad parents and should not even be considered for adoption.",0,1
"Immigrants can be a useful resource for a country, however, I think they can also be a drain if there are no policies in place. My parents were refugees to this country, and entered in legally. Migrants are those who enter legally for one reason or another, and I think they are useful and the basis of this country. If we can help people by letting them in and using them to advance our industry and economy, I think its a great idea. Those who benefit society should be allowed into it.",1,1
"We don't know the full effects of cannabis on the brain. On the growing individual, teenager, young adult, or fetus, it can have side effects in the development that we aren't aware of. We also aren't fully aware of all the chemicals in cannabis nor their effects on the body. We also aren't quite sure how addictive cannabis really is. We cannot easily detect it as we do alcohol, so legalizing it for recreational use everywhere, is a mistake.",0,1
"While not something one should be proud of, abortion is a reality of an advanced species like humans. While there should be limits on abortion, it is ultimately a woman's decision on whether she wants to carry a pregnancy to term. Government should take steps to reduce abortions, through sex education and contraceptives, but it should also ensure safe abortions can occur to protect women seeking abortions from harm. Federal law should regulate abortions to ensure equal access throughout the country.",1,1
"If a government's role is to protect its citizens from harm, then any government should oppose euthanasia. Many people may change their mind during the process and there is a risk that such powerful drugs used in the process may fall in the wrong hands. No one person should have the right to help another person end their life. It is the role of professionals to uphold human life and dignity, not destroy it.",0,1
"While homosexuality has existed throughout human history, the normalization of the behavior through marriage has not been a tradition. Marriage, especially in the modern Western tradition, has been a role of religious organizations. Therefore, the government should not become involved in adding another type of marriage to Western tradition. It should honor the traditions of the past.",0,1
"The United States is a nation made of immigrants. The U.S. should welcome immigrants, specifically through legal means with potential options for undocumented aliens to become citizens. The U.S. birthrate is dependent on migrants entering the U.S. and starting families. All refugees and immigrants should be screened before entering the U.S. (not tourists).",1,1
"Any legal drug can have harmful effects on its user. While cannabis may not be as harmful as many other drugs, it still disorientates its users and is often inhaled through smoke. As legal access increases, the chances of minors using the drug also increases (with the effects of cannabis on brain function in minors being negative). Legalization could normalize the behavior and make it normal for citizens to engage in.",0,1
"It is not something I would want to have to do myself, which is why I take all the necessary precautions to prevent pregnancy until I am ready to start a family. However, abortion should be legal and all women should have access and rights to receive one if they feel they need to. It is nobody else's decision whether or not a women should or should not be able to have an abortion. I fully support a woman's right to choose.",1,1
"Euthanasia is wrong. Only God can decide when it is a person's time to die. Any doctor who performs this on a patient should be punished by the full extent of the law. They are literally committing murder. Also, a person who chooses to take the route of euthanasia, is committing suicide which is a sin. They will go to hell and so will the people who aid in their endeavor. Life is sad and painful but never worth giving up, no matter how much pain or suffering it entails.",0,1
"Gay marriage should be illegal because the bible describes marriage as a man and woman uniting in the eyes of God. It is immoral for two men or two women to lay in bed together and these people do not deserve the same rights a decent, moral, heterosexual Christian people. If we give them the rights to marry, what will they ask for next? They'll want it all, to adopt children and everything else. They just keep rubbing it in our faces with the flags and the parades. They should just keep their immoral lifestyle to themselves, the way people used to do.",0,1
"Migrants are the backbone of our country and should have more rights here. Would it be nice if we could document everyone the right way and make everything fair? Of course, but that is literally impossible. My family came over here as immigrants and my grandmother had to start work when she was 11 years old. She had no rights or proper access to good health care and when she came down with Rheumatic fever, her parents had to give her up to the state so they could take care of her. We need to look after people of all walks of life in this country, including migrants. They are human and they have rights, like anyone else.",1,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized because it is a drug. It ranges in spectrum from potency and it is very difficult to label THC content in the same way that alcohol can be labeled (i.e. 5%, 7%, 10% etc.). Weed all looks the same and it's hard to tell someone, ""Hey, be careful... this is way more intense than the last batch"". This is why it can't be legal. How could the government label it properly? Young kids start out altering their state with cannabis and then it opens them up to ""feeling loose"". They call it a gateway drug because it is one. Cannabis selling is what many criminals do and keeping it illegal helps our police find these criminals. We need to make a statement to the youth that we are a good, moral nation and we don't tolerate drug use.",0,1
I think it should be allowed. It is a woman's right to choose. Late term abortion is problematic though. I think there is an exception for late trimester.,1,1
People should live through the pain. It builds character. It is a cowardly and selfish way to end life. It may hurt others more too.,0,1
Gays are evil. They are unnatural. They are not god's will. It's weird also.,0,1
They help society. They want a better life. They may work hard. But there is a legal route.,1,1
"Cannabis is a gateway to heroin. If you allow cannabis, what won't you allow? Kids can get addicted. There may be an increase in DUIs.",0,1
"I believe that abortion should always be legal. Women should have the right to decide whether or not they want to have children. No woman should be forced to have a child against her will, especially if she is a rape or incest victim, or her life is threatened by the pregnancy. The government should not make that decision for women.",1,1
"Euthanasia should not be permitted because it is murder. People who are dying should be given sufficient pain medication to ease their suffering, but not be killed. People should not be allowed to choose this option, either, because they may not be in their right minds when doing so. Some doctors want euthanasia to be legal everywhere so they can charge money to kill their patients.",0,1
"Gay marriage is just plain unnatural. God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. Men were created to fit women, not other men. Gay couples can't produce children, either.",0,1
"Migrants seeking asylum should be allowed to enter the U.S. and stay while their applications are being reviewed. Migrants who have entered the U.S. should be treated humanely. It is wrong and unnecessary to separate migrant families that have entered the country. If migrants seeking asylum do not meet the requirements for asylum status, then they should be sent back to their countries.",1,1
Marijuana shouldn't be legal because it is a gateway drug; it leads users to experiment with more dangerous drugs. Potheads are notoriously poor workers and can't concentrate on their jobs. Making marijuana legal will cause people who are addicted to other illegal drugs to demand that they be legalized as well. There are also negative health effects caused by marijuana use.,0,1
"I believe abortion is ethical. There are many situations where I believe it to be appropriate for a woman to have an abortion, such as when her life it at risk due to a complication with her pregnancy, or when she is impregnated through a rape.  It is becoming more main-stream for a woman to abort an unplanned pregnancy, and I believe it is within her right to do so. It is her body, and she may choose to not use it to produce and then raise a child. I think it should be encouraged for her to go through with the pregnancy and then put the child up for adoption, but again it is her body; her choice.",1,1
"Euthanasia is simply wrong. There is no situation where a living being would benefit from death; it simply doesn't make sense. If God intended for a person to die, then they would. If they have to power to push through their sickness and pain, then he still has a plan for them. Euthanasia is murder and assisted suicide even if the victim welcomes it. It is unnatural and unethical.",0,1
"Gay marriage should not be allowed as it is a disgrace against the word of our Lord. It goes against everything our great country was built for, and put simply is a disgusting act. It violates what marriage means, and outright violates our society. Gay marriage is about as unnatural as a person can get, and should not be allowed in our great country. I refuse to subject my children to having to see a man with a man, or a woman with a woman in such a way. I should not have to explain to them the sickness that those people are afflicted with.",0,1
"I believe migrants should be permitted, provided they go through the proper steps to enter the country. They are generally people looking to improve their lives by moving somewhere that is more stable, and should therefore be given that chance. Again, proper screening and background checks are necessary, and they should be followed up with even after their settling into the country. While there may be a risk of allowing a ""bad"" person through, that risk does not outweigh the benefits for those who are good and our society.",1,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized simply because it is a drug. Drugs do not benefit people at all and are one of biggest ""plagues"" on this country. There is no reason that we should have to raise our children around people who use drugs, as all they do is cause an unsafe environment for them to live. One could argue that Cannabis is not a ""hard"" drug, and is therefore harmless but that simply isn't true! Cannabis is a gateway drug to a bigger, deadlier world of drugs for people to get lost in. It simply does not benefit anybody in any positive way.",0,1
