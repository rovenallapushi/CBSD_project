I think it should not be a womans choice whether or not to keep their baby. There are plenty of other options for a woman other than aborting a fetus so they shouldn't get to play God with someone elses life. It is not a form of birth control.,0,1
I think this is awful. Only God can decide when it's time for someone to go. No one else should get to make this decision. I think it is awful to put this option in anyone elses hands besides God. It is not our choice to make this decision.,1,1
"I think gay marriage is a great thing. No one is told who to marry so why should it matter if they choose to marry the same sex. Why get married to someone of the opposite sex just so that you're doing it the right way. Who's to say there is a right way? If the person you are about to marry treats you right, it shouldn't matter what sex they are.",1,1
Migrants should be welcome with no government restrictions. This nation was founded on migrants so why not let everyone come over. The more the merrier. We will figure it out and there is plenty to go around.,0,1
"Why not start having to pay tax on it and regulate it so everyone is safe. People will smoke weed anyway so if we make it a public forum, we will be able to make sure people are more safe about it. We legalized alcohol so why not weed?",1,1
Abortion should be up to the parent the parent should 100 percent be certain before they go through the abortion but i believe abortion is the right way to go if the baby will have no quality of life and has a bunch of informities. Abortion should not happen when the child is fully developed.,0,1
I believe euthanasia depends if an animal can physically not go on and doesnt have quality of life but if they euthanize just because the animal is old then i have a problem with it. Vets are to easily euthanizing animals that are adopted wish there was a better way.,1,1
Well my opinion about gay marriage is that i dont believe its right god invented a man and a woman adam and eve. But i also believe that i guess if your happy and you dont push it in my face or have to see or hear about it then im fine who am i to judge how someone else lives there life.,1,1
I believe if a migrant wants to come over for the right reasons than im all for it but do it the right legalize way but if there coming over here to sell drugs and illegal activity then im against it. Most immigrants that come over are wanting to sell drugs to there counterparts over there in mexico.,0,1
I believe cannabis legalization would be awsome if it was legal all over the united states not only would the states profit off it the towns and cities can grow from the profit of marijuana. It also helps pain patients get off those really addictive pain pills that the doctors push onto there patients.,1,1
Abortion should be legal. It is every womans choice whether or not she wants the baby that she becomes pregnant with. Pro-choice is the best choice. What if a woman gets raped? She should not have to go through with that. It is her choice.,0,1
"Euthanasia is done to both animals and humans. While many say it is necessary and okay, it hurts me. I do not like it. It is our way of playing God. When we put our animals to sleep it may be a necessary evil, but it does not mean that it doesn't hurt.",1,1
"Gay marriage is a sin. The Bible tells me so. Even with that being said, I still love these people. This is not the essence of Christianity.",1,1
Migrants should not have the chance to get jobs in the United States. They take jobs away from Americans. Americans need the jobs that are here. There are not enough jobs as is. Why should we have to deal with immigrants? Build the wall!,0,1
"Weed is legal in my state now. I do not agree with it, especially not for recreational use. Everywhere I go, I have to smell it. There are people who smell like it everywhere I go. I hate it. I also do not want my children to have to deal with this.",1,1
Murders! Anyone who has an abortion is a murderer.,0,1
If this is what the person in the coma requested prior then I think it is just fine since the coma can not be reveresed but only if it is what the patient requested.,1,1
"I have no problem with this, it actually bothers me when people are against it. Who are we to tell someone they can not marry the person they love?!",1,1
Hire illegal immigrants for cheaper pay.,0,1
It needs to be leaglized both medically and recreationally. I live in a state that just legalized it medically but not a lot of dr are willing to prescribe this naturual product.,1,1
"I think abortion should be allowed for everyone. It's their body and they should be able to choose what they want to do with it. Fetuses aren't complete ""human"" yet so it shouldn't be seen as murder.",0,1
"I would never personally do it, but if someone chooses to end their own life, they should have the right to do so. It's better for them to not suffer with assisted suicide than to suffer through performing it on themselves. It's their life so they should be able to choose to end it however they wish. Better to do it under supervision than by themselves.",1,1
"I feel that gay marriage should be allowed as long as it's not marriage in a Christian sense. This means that they should be allowed to legally marry (under law). However, to force the Church to recognize that it is marriage under God's design is what I don't agree with.",1,1
Those that weren't born here should not have the right to stay in a country they illegally came to. It's not safe for citizens and the country's security. To ignore this issue is to put the country and those who live in it at risk.,0,1
"I do not know too much about cannabis, but if study shows that it is not as dangerous as it's said to be, I think it's fine. It would bring tax revenue to the states while lowering crime and arrests of possession. I've heard it's not as bad as alcohol so if that's true, then that's another reason for legalization.",1,1
abortion should not be legal under any circumstances.,0,1
Euthanasia should probably be legal just cause if someone really doesnt want to live they will off themselves in ways that could possible be detrimental to society like jumping onto train tracks or off of buildings. Also if that person is professionally euthanized then they will likely be subject to less pain than if they were to just commit suicide. Strictly from a pragmatic sense it should be allowed.,1,1
I am of the opinion that gay marriage should be a right under the law of any two individuals who wish to be so. As a result of this belief I also believe that gay marriages should be a right guaranteed under the law of any gay couple who should want to be married.,1,1
I believe that people from certain countries shouldnt be allowed to migrate to the united states,0,1
Cannabis should be legal because people are gonna do it anyway so we might as well be able to generate tax revenue from it.,1,1
Abortion should be legal. It is always the choice of the woman. This is her body and she has every right to decide. A fetus is technically part of her body until the cord is cut. Let woman choose what's best for their life and body. Keep government out of the decision.,0,1
"The right to die is a difficult subject. If the quality of life is so bad and there is no way to ever recover, then euthanasia should be an option. I worry doctors would rather take this route over conventional medicine to save money. I feel many times its a financial decision more than an ethical decision. I think a change in healthcare laws would prevent people from choosing euthanasia. If they could afford to live, then I believe they would choose life over death.",1,1
I grew up in a conservative religious family. My belief of marriage is that it is between a man and a woman. One of our main purposes on this earth from a religious and scientific standpoint is to become adults and reproduce which is the cycle in every living thing. Therefore gay marriage conflicts with these concepts on both sides of the spectrum. If two men or women want to be together that is fine with me. It is the sacred marriage that I have trouble accepting.,1,1
We were built on a nation of migrants. They do the work that many don't want to do. We are a wealthy nation and have the space and resource to help all people. Here they can find a safe and fruitful life. Be able to raise a family and support them. Service to others should a main priority in our morals and values. Let those who are here. stay here without fear or prejudice.,0,1
I think this is a made decision to legalize. We don't have enough long term studies to truly no the effects of THC. Any drug you use without moderation is harmful. I think it should only be under a doctors prescription and supervision.This would protect children from using and abuse this drug at an early age.,1,1
"Life is given by God as a gift to mothers. Abortion is the taking away of that life from children that have no choice in the matter. Abortion harms the mother, kills the child, and takes a child out of someone's hands.",0,1
"Euthanasia is a difficult task to talk about since it involves death. But I believe it boils down to the right to liberty, the right to a persons own body, to keep or take their life in times of dire need. Much like the refusal of treatment in hospitals if the patient is able to competently deny treatment, euthanasia should also be allowed for those who deny treatment and want to take their health and life into their own hands, especially and mostly in times of almost certain death and prolonged pain and suffering. I think it should be a last resort, but I think keeping people alive that have no real life to live besides being basically a machine on a bed is not a life worth living.",1,1
"I believe gay marriage should be legalized in all cases. I can't imagine any scenario in which gay marriage should not be legal. The only basis for defense against gay marriage is religious and social implications. Otherwise, it should have been legal decades ago.",1,1
"(From an american's perspective). Those seeking refuge in this country should be welcomed with open arms. ""Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."" We are a country founded by immigrants, (currently) actively fighting against the very forces that built this country. People seek asylum from difficult countries, and it is our job to allow them to enter. People say that ""bad people"" are coming into our country, but the statistics simply do not show this (especially on the border wall, but let's not get started on that atrocity.)",0,1
"My main problem with cannabis is that it is harmful to people under the age of 18, sometimes 21 depending on the research presented. But cannabis can help with many medical issues, is not addictive, has few to no side effects (based on general research. Some research has shown that excess use can lead to some medical problems, and, as mentioned, in underage users), and is basically impossible to overdose on (again, generally, not counting factors such as driving). It should be treated very similarly to alcohol, requiring carding/containment/legal age usage, but in terms of being legally able to purchase it, it is generally less harmful than alcohol and should be treated in the same category, especially considering that alcohol is never prescribed for medical use, whereas marijuana is.",1,1
"I believe we should not allow women to abort their unborn babies. The Bible says that it is wrong. A life is a life. We should not play God. If women don't want their children, there are lots of loving families out there who would love to adopt them. Abortion is murder.",0,1
"I believe euthanasia should be legalized in certain cases. A person has the right to die with dignity. If they are very ill and suffering, it is not right to make a person go on living if they don't wish to. If euthanasia were legal, the terminally ill could die in peace with the help of a trusted doctor at the right time in a humane way. Making euthanasia illegal only adds to the suffering of a dying patient.",1,1
"I believe gay marriage should be legalized. It is no one else's business if two people love each other and want to be together. In a day and age where high moral standards of living are rare, we should be praising two people who want to take an oath of commitment. Making gay marriage illegal only sends the message that there is something shameful about being gay. That is the mindset that has driven so many to feelings of depression and hopelessness. Let he is without sin cast the first stone. We have no right to judge others.",1,1
"I don't believe it is our country's responsibility to save the rest of the world. We should keep our citizens safe first and foremost. We don't have the money, space or resources to waste trying to help other people when we have enough problems of our own. Migrants are dangerous. We need to protect our country.",0,1
I don't believe that cannabis should be legalized except in extreme cases. People tend to think that there are no side effects of smoking marijuana and I believe if it were legalized people would be smoking at inappropriate times of day and in inappropriate places. I believe cannabis can affect a person in some of the same ways alcohol can. It also can cause or exacerbate long-term mental illnesses. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it is safe.,1,1
"Every woman has a right to make decisions about their body in any way they wish. When a child is conceived, a woman goes through many changes that she may not have the mental or physical strength to deal with for the next 9 months. Not only that, many teenagers are getting pregnant and are unable to care for the babies that would come if an abortion was not obtained. Abortion is beneficial in many cases and should be legal in all states. It's not only a benefit to women, but a benefit to society as well.",0,1
"Euthanasia should be illegal in all circumstances no matter the reason. It is not only harmful to the administering doctor, but to the family. The patient takes the dosage on their own, but the doctor still gives it to them willingly. This not only makes the doctor a witness to suicide without intervention, but also in my mind, a murderer. In our country, murderers are sentenced to death or life in prison. Why is it alright to allow someone to kill themselves and to assist them in doing so? It isn't and never will be. I stand firm. Euthanasia should be outlawed and made illegal worldwide.",1,1
"Gay marriage should be legal in all states regardless of background. All people are humans and just because they identify with a particular set of beliefs doesn't constitute taking their basic rights away. Some people do not condone the acts of the LGBT community and would do anything to stop further progress. For myself, I believe we are all entitled to the right to choose how we wish to live. I may not agree with gay marriage, but I do agree with the right to choose and our freedom.",1,1
"Migrants are very beneficial to our country. If you think back, we are all decendants of migrants. Migrants bring skills and culture to our country. There should be no reason to limit or stop immigrants from migrating to the United States. There can be rules, but any and all people who wish to migrate to the United States should be able too. I truly believe that our society can grow and become a better with a new culture breeding among us.",0,1
"Cannabis is here to stay and has always been here. The only reason that it is not legal in all states, is that the US Government hadn't figured out a way to tax it and make profit until recently. With the crackdown on illegal drug smuggling, the government has realized that the amount of money that can be made is substantial through legalization. That is why so many states are adopting legalization of cannabis. My view is that it should be made legal. There is no point to fine and jail users/dealers when it does not stop the problem. The government should embrace that fact and profit on it as they do with everything else.",1,1
Abortion is dangerous to the human body. Abortion results in lifetime mental suffering and stress. People who get abortions don't care about life. People who get abortions are not accountable in their lives and solving their problems.,0,1
"I believe Euthanasia should be legal. It is just wrong to watch a person suffer and know there is no hope. Euthanasia is a relief to people who are dying and in pain. I know I would not want to live that way. I would want my life to end as quickly as possible. More studies need to be done on this topic. I value the quality of life, and there is no life worth living when you are suffering, in pain, and have no hope to recover.",1,1
"I fully support gay marriage. My daughter is gay and has been happily married to Lila for three years. People should be free to love who they want. Gender should not be an issue. My daughter is a strong woman, and I fully support her and her wife.",1,1
Migrants keep jobs from deserving Americans. Migrants want to take over our country and make our economy weak. Migrants are plotting to get everything they can from Americans. Migrants are lazy and unaccountable.,0,1
I believe cannabis should be legal. People purchase it anyway. Cannabis is very helpful to people with emotional problems and people suffering chronic pain. Cannabis has been found to relieve pain symptoms. Cannabis also helps with mental stress issues.,1,1
I think that is is wrong to abort a child. The child is alive at the time of conception. It is murder plain and simple.,0,1
I hate to even think of the word. I feel that if someone truly wants to die then maybe they should be given that right but only if they are sane enough to make that decision and only if they are suffering and near death.,1,1
I think that gay people should have the right to get married. If 2 people love each other than we shouldn't tell them they can not enter into marriage. Marriage makes them legal family and that is important when it comes to medical things and inheritance.,1,1
I don't think they should be allowed to stay here. We have our own people to take care of that are not being taken care of.,0,1
I think that it would actually help if it was legalized. I suffer from Fibromyalgia and other painful ailments. I am in constant horrible pain. All the pain medicines have been taken from people like me because of others who abused it. If cannabis was legalized it would enable drug companies to be able to freely study the benefits of cannabis and perhaps put some natural drugs out there to help people like me and others.,1,1
"I feel abortion is a necessary evil. Having a baby is a tremendously wonderful experience. However, being pregnant from a rape would make this a horrible experience. If the pregnancy will end in the death of the mother, how hard would that decision be to make. If for any reason it is an unwanted pregnancy, the child will suffer. But my main reason for abortion being legal is it is the right of any woman to decide if she wants to carry a child for 40 weeks! America is made on the right of people to decide for themselves.",1,1
Euthanasia is not compassionate! No matter how you turn Euthanasia it is just MURDER. How can people who are so sick be in their right mind to ask for Euthanasia? No one but God has the right to end a life.,0,1
Gay Marriage is just plain wrong! God meant for two people to be married for the purpose of having children. Gays are just unnatural desires. Gays also have a higher risk of catching Aids than heterosexual people.,0,1
"Migrants are people who move within a country; i.e. from Virginia to Oregon. I believe anyone should be able to live anywhere they want within their own country. Some state laws, such as legal marijuana, make it necessary for some people with cancer or children with rare diseases to be able to obtain their marijana via a prescription.",1,1
"Cannabis is a natural form of medicine. I believe it should be legalized everywhere. The use of this for medical purposes or even recreational use is a right that everyone should have, considering alcohol and tobacco are legal and much more dangerous. I do like the regulation of Cannabis however. This way it stays pure and the government could use the taxes from such a wonderful natural medicine.",1,1
"Abortion is simply killing babies. The mother for whatever reason does not want the baby, so she decides to kill it. Society practically worships ""endangered species"" such as certain fish, but killing humans seems to be OK. The doctors who perform abortions are murderers with no conscience. These abortion doctors are willing to murder what God created and get pay for it.",1,1
"Euthanasia should be legal and accepted in our country. If society believes a person should die because of severe retardation, extreme illness, or severe depression, it must be OK to allow that person to die. The elderly have not much use in our world, and they get ill, experience pain, and cannot contribute. We should be allowed to decide if they're contributing or taking away resources for our country.",0,1
"It should be okay for men to marry men and women to marry women. It's a free country and a free world, so why is it wrong? If people can be happier marrying someone of the same sex, why limit their happiness? America is supposed to be built on the pursuit of happiness. Gay marriage isn't hurting anyone else who doesn't agree with it.",0,1
"Migrants need to stay in their own countries. Why should the US have to pay for free housing, education, welfare, healthcare for those who have not put any money into the US? These people are breaking the law by coming here illegally. If they do that now, then why would they obey any other laws in America as they're already criminals? The rates of crime increase with illegal aliens.",1,1
"Marijuana for recreational and medicinal use should be legal. If alcohol is legal for 18 or 21 and older, why shouldn't pot be legal? Marijuana takes away pain and helps people with chronic disease. Marijuana is not a drug that leads to other more dangerous drug use any more or less than alcohol does.",1,1
Abortion is a very difficult subject and is not easy to decide upon. I believe that we should have restrictions on the amount and types of abortions allowable. THere needs to be a good cause. Religiously speaking it should not be allowed unless the mother is in danger.,1,1
Euthanasia is a cruel and demeaning practice. It should be outlawed. It is a violation of human rights and most religious practices. It is on the same level as murder.,0,1
Gay marraige is great. It allows loving same sex couples to legally bind their relationship the same as heterosexual couples. It is good for our culture.,0,1
Legal migration is important for our country. It allows new people to become Americans and add to our nation. Illegal immigration should be stopped and new laws and measures should be put into place to stop this. It is not good to allow any and all to enter the country.,1,1
I think that the legalization of pot should be ok within limits. There has to be government oversight and strict limits on how much can be sold and to whom. It is a drug and needs to be controlled.,1,1
abortion should be illegal in all cases. a baby is a living thing as soon as it is conceived and it is murder to kill it. it is illegal to kill another human being so it should be the same for an abortion. in no case should we kill a baby because god made the baby for a reason.,1,0
"euthanasia should be illegal because it is unethical. it is up to god to decide when we live or die. even though some people suffer greatly, we cant interfere with god's plan. it can have disastrous consequences and the people who are suffering are not always in the right state of mind to make decisions. we should not be allowed to say when someone is done living under any circumstances.",0,0
gay marriage should be legal. we should be able to choose who we want to marry. you can't help who you fall in love with and putting a ban on something in unethical. america is the land of the free and banning marriage of any kind is only going to make people angry and want to do it more. it doesn't hurt anyone to let gay people marry.,0,0
"migrants should not be allowed into the country. they come over here and take our jobs and resources. all of the welfare they get in their children's name because they come here pregnant and give birth. now these ""american citizens"" have a free pass to stay in the country while others going through the legal process do not. there is not enough money for welfare for the people already over here, let alone the ones who should not be here and we are all supporting with our tax dollars.",1,1
"cannabis should be legalized in all states. if we don't legalize it, it will only become a worse problem for everyone. people are going to do drugs anyways and cannabis has been proven time and again to be harmless. it actually has a lot of benefits and is helpful to those who are terminally ill and suffering. making it legal will make things easier for the economy, law enforcement and ill people.",1,1
"As a man, I feel that only women should have an opinion that matters on abortion. I think that there is a choice and that choice is up to the woman in the situation. Pro-choice can chose what they want to do with their bodies, and Pro-life have made a statement what they have chosen to do with their bodies. One interesting thing I've heard is that many women who are Pro-choice have admitted that while they do not believe in abortion for themselves, they didn't understand that their stance would keep other women from making a choice. Religion does funny things to some people.",1,1
"While no one has any say on how they enter the world or who their family is. I think every human should have the right to say how they exit the world, with dignity and humanity.",0,1
Two men marrying or two women marrying devalues my marriage to my wife as a man. And god thinks its wrong because I read the bible cover to cover.,0,1
"This country was founded on migrants and immigrants while forcibly taking it from the Native Americans. A common sense immigration policy is what we need, but unfortunately won't get.",1,1
"It's already legal recreationally in several states and medicinally in many more and the earth has not exploded. Once big pharma really sinks it's hooks into the legal/medicinal industry, there will be lobbyists pushing the government to decriminalize across the country.",1,1
"I hate to think about a baby (yes, baby, not fetus) at just 10 weeks gestation being ripped out of a woman. I also hate to think about women who find themselves pregnant and terrified of going through the ordeal. What I really think would be best if it was possible for no one to get pregnant unless they wanted to. We need 100% foolproof methods of contraception (and no, I don't mean abstinence). Wouldn't it be wonderful if abortion was legal, but no one ever needed an abortion? We need to stop thinking about just the legality and thinking about making it possible not to NEED abortions.",1,1
"The bible says it is wrong to kill no matter what. If we take our own life or help someone else take their life, we will be damned forever. There is enough medicine now to keep people out of pain. If someone is in that much pain that they want to die, they can just be medicated so they don't feel anything. Even if they hang on for years and years, that is better than killing them. If we allow people to kill themselves just because they are terminally ill, maybe sick people in the future will all be killed.",0,1
"The bible says that gay marriage is wrong. So, it is wrong. That's it. Those people will just teach our children how to be gay and then our children will grow up gay. Those people are just hurting our country by pretending to be something that isn't real. They are just doing it for attention.",0,1
"My ancestors were once migrants, coming to America for a chance for a better life. We don't have any idea of what these people have gone through to want them to risk death and injury for themselves and their families in order to get to a safe place. We need to stop thinking about ways to keep them out and think about ways to help them. I never understood why the Trump Administration wants to separate families. That just costs more money. If you take an infant from it's mother, you need to pay someone to take care of the infant. Why not keep families together to take care of themselves, and help them either immigrate to America or another country?",1,1
"I think cannabis is being legalized no matter what. I think it may help our economy, but I am also afraid it will hurt our future generations. I see teenagers not learning anything and graduating from high school. I am worried that this is just something else that will take their minds off learning to work for a living. I am all for the parts of the cannabis plant that offer medicinal value or other use. I think we need to do more research finding ways that cannabis helps. I am for legalization, but I am a bit worried about the consequences.",1,1
"I think that abortion should be a right for women that is unrestricted and easily accessible throughout the first two trimesters. The U.S. government has shown via court rulings that the rights of the fetus outweigh the interests of the mother beyond that point. To me, fights against abortion are often rather fights against the progression of women's rights and their ability to make their own decisions. Allowing abortions has been shown to lower crime rates as well as keep women and children out of situations they could avoid via abortion. Thus, it is in the best interest of citizens to allow abortions freely.",1,1
"Allowing euthanasia takes the decision of life and death from the hands of God to the hands of a doctor or individual. Individuals can often be in a poor state of mind when they feel as if they need to take their own lives. This can be a result of both mental issues as well as physical symptoms of disease. Allowing such would allow doctors or individuals to, in essence, play God with their jobs and decision making. This would be an abomination if allowed to stand.",0,1
"The biblical traditions that this country was founded upon are contradicted by the institution of gay marriage. Allowing gays the marry dilutes the value of traditional man and woman marriages. Thus, our critical family values and the nuclear family mold that this country was founded upon begin to hang in the balance. In order to save this country from its downfall, we need to prevent the spread and legalization of gay marriage.",0,1
"Migrants should have a quick, fair and accessible legal path towards citizenship and entering the country. The United States was founded upon the ideas of immigrants and those from other countries and it is contradictory to go back upon those founding values. The vast majority of those entering the country are law abiding citizens interested in bettering their lives through job opportunities. They are not criminals or ""job vultures"" but rather are coming in to often take jobs that Americans typically don't want to do. The fights against illegal immigration and the policy talks surrounding the issue have been a lost cause thus far and the funding could be used in more useful ways.",1,1
The fight against cannabis has been a losing battle for decades. Cannabis has been shown to be less damaging than alcohol and many commonly abused recreational and prescription drugs taken by many every days. The war on drugs was initiated to incarcerate African-American and Hispanic citizens are marginalize their communities via policing. Lobbying efforts have been the sole factor preventing marijuana legalization and it is idiotic to spend another day or dollar countering marijuana. Marijuana has a bright future both from a medical and economic standpoint.,1,1
Women should have the right to choose want to do with their bodies. Medical science provides women with the option to carry a pregnancy to term or end it. It is immoral to regulate the use of medical science. Most anti-abortion opponents rely on outmoded patriarchy and religious prosecution to form their opinions.,1,1
Medical science has allowed people to die peacefully and like abortion it should not be kept from the public. Only religious fanatics have a problem with assisted-suicide. It was save societies millions of dollars in health-care costs.,0,1
Marriage is between a man and woman as defined by civil society and the church for millennia. It would be whimsical to change that now. If a relationship cannot produce offspring that it is not a marriage.,0,1
"All civilized countries allow immigration of some kind. The United States shares a continent with Latin American countries it has kept poor due to its imperialist foreign policies. It has to live with those decisions and allow a pathway to migration for poor asylum seekers. Having open borders is going a bit too far, but there should be a liberal immigration policy in the US. Migrant children should not be held captive by border authorities.",1,1
Marijuana is a harmless recreational drug that should have never been criminalized. It was kept illegal by a tobacco lobby that feared competition. It has medicinal properties that should be made legal. The policies of the United States are brutal and injustice and lead to the over-incarceration of innocent people.,1,1
"Regarding abortion, I lean toward being pro-life. I feel that life matters, and that unborn babies are entitled to that life just as much as those that are already here. However...I also understand that there are circumstances in which abortion may be necessary, as in the case of a medical condition affecting the mother and/or baby, and I think that it's important for parents to have the option available to them in those situations. I also believe that, no matter how people feel, abortion will exist, and that our responsibility is to create a system in which it isn't deemed necessary as often (better sex education, more access to birth control), and to make sure it's done safely when it happens.",1,1
"Euthanasia is completely wrong; to take one's own life, for any reason, is weak and selfish. You are robbing your loved ones of their friend and/or family member, and you are missing out on all of the wonderful things that life still has in store for you. Doctors don't know everything, and you never know when a cure for whatever ails you may be discovered or further developed. Furthermore, to claim you want to spare your family the pain of seeing you in a diminished state is self-centered; caring for a sick loved one is a privilege and builds individual strength.",0,1
"Gay marriage is an abomination to God and is destroying the foundation of legitimate man/woman marriages. Being gay is a sin, and to allow them to be legally married is condoning and celebrating that sickness rather than weeding it out as we should be doing. Instead of allowing gays to be married, we should be working harder to help them heal and accept that their condition is unnatural. If they are allowed to get married, children will grow up believing that it's ok and it will destroy our society.",0,1
"For the most part, I feel that migrants should be welcome. All Americans (aside from Native Americans) descended from migrants; I don't think we have the right to tell anyone that they can't come here. I also feel that people should strive to help each other; if migrants are coming here in search of a better life, why not help them achieve that instead of leaving them to suffer? I think the claims that most migrants are violent drug dealers and gang members are completely ridiculous; America breeds plenty of its own violent drug dealers.",1,1
"I believe cannabis should be legalized, as I feel its effects are no different (and perhaps even safer) than those of alcohol or tobacco. It also provides many healthy benefits, and can help to boost the economy. Among other things, money made from legalizing cannabis can be used to strengthen community infrastructures and provide more funding for schools. Furthermore, though cannabis is considered relatively safe, selling it legally will mean the product will have to pass certain safety guidelines, which will (theoretically) diminish cases of people being adversely affected because it's mixed with something harmful.",1,1
I believe it;s a womens decision. I feel in cases of sexual assault people should be more understanding. I believe it is ok til the baby has hit  certain developments. I don;t believe the father's should have a say.,1,1
I think if someone is terminal they are not thinking right to make that decision. We are humans not an animal. I think the person who performs that should face murder charges. I just personally feel it is taking another's life.,0,1
I just think it's wrong. God did not intend to have Adam and Steve. They can't have children naturally together so they are  not like real married people. I think they made too big of a deal over being married when it's really not natural.,0,1
I think they should not be allowed to cross the border and live here. I think they take jobs away from the people who are citizens. I feel our government supports them way to much food stamps housing etc.,1,1
I think it should be legalized everywhere. I also think it should be legalized on the federal level. I don't believe cannabis cause a lot of problems like other drugs do. I think it also has many medicinal purposes.,1,1
Abortion is a morally correct option. It means that a child is not born into a world that cannot take care of it. It is also important for the safety of the mother. It is not murder to abort a fetus.,1,1
Euthanasia is immoral and against the plan of God. It is murder. Killing another person is never acceptable.,0,1
Gay marriage is wrong. They will go to hell. Marriage is between a man and a woman and it should not be allowed.,0,1
"Migrants should be vetted and welcomed into the country if they are trustworthy, honest people. Bad immigrants, and illegal immigrants should not be allowed into the country. Legal immigrants should be welcomed with more respect.",1,1
Cannibals should be legalized. It is healthier than alcohol and the taxes that come from its sale would benefit the country. As long as laws were enforced like DUI we would be in a better world.,1,1
"I feel like women should be given the right to choose for themselves, within reason. I believe that the fetus should qualify as a person once it is capable of surviving outside the womb. At this point of pregnancy, it should be illegal to perform an abortion. However, within the first couple months of pregnancy, I definitely believe abortions should be allowed, but not necessarily paid for by social programs or insurance. I know this is a controversial topic, but it is not a person's place to decide what other people can or can't do with their bodies. If we're going to allow mentally ill people to take hormones and augment their genitals to appear like the opposite sex, then I think we should allow these women to make a choice that has a chance to improve their lives, even if it is at the expense of another life. That life expended may have endured a lifetime of suffering.",1,1
"Euthanasia should not be allowed. It is not the responsibility of another person to make the choice of terminating the existence of another life. There are no circumstances in which this should be tolerated. All lives should be afforded the opportunity to expire on their own, in their own time.",0,1
"Gay marriage is great! It's one of the best ways to improve our society. By allowing gay people to marry, we send a generalized message to the population that they can be themselves, even if they are much more likely to contract HIV and can never have children without a member of the opposite sex. We should even allow gay couples to direct the futures of our children. Since they have chosen not to have any children, it only seems logical that we allow them to mold other people's children.",0,1
"I have no issue with migrants in the way the word is defined in the dictionary. However, when people who are not citizens of my country come to my country to work, that is a different situation. One side of the political spectrum will argue that certain citizens just don't want to do certain kinds of jobs. In fact, that is true, but entirely misleading. I would argue that the majority of the workforce in my country doesn't actually want to do their jobs. Unfortunately, earning a living is a necessity for many and not specifically enjoyable. When migrant workers occupy jobs, they are literally removing opportunities from citizens who are definitely more entitled to these opportunities than non-citizens. In addition, many who are not citizens do not pay taxes but are allowed to benefit by the social programs the taxes fund. Overall, illegal migrants and workers should remain illegal and be punished more strictly and consistently for the benefit of citizens and not the political agenda of a popular party.",1,1
"This is an easy one, in my opinion. Cannabis, as a drug, is much safer than legal substances like alcohol. Users are generally passive, private, and non-confrontational. The substance has no real side-effects and does not create a physical dependence. If we were to legalize Cannabis, we would generate a lot of tax revenue for use in improving society. In addition, we would save a lot of money in justice system costs, like court processing fees and the cost to incarcerate people.",1,1
ABORTION IS EVERYONE OWN CHOICE. IT IS SOMETHING GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE. LIFE WILL BE LOST. YOU MAY NEED GUIDANCE TO SUCCEED. CAN YOU STAND THE EMOTIONAL PRESSURE.,1,1
I CANNOT TOLERATE PEOPLE BEING PUT TO DEATH IN SUCH A AWFUL POSITION. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN USA. I NEVER READ OF THIS BEFORE. PEOPLE CANNOT MAKE SUCH DECISIONS.,0,1

"Abortion should be safe and legal for all who want it. Abortion should not be legislated by the government because the government should not tell women what they can and cannot do with their bodies. It is a woman's right to choose what and how she wants to do with her body, and that includes any unborn children. I do believe that abortion should be illegal after a certain period of time, but that it should be legal up to a certain timeframe.",1,1
"Euthanasia is murder. Even if the dying person wishes to be euthanized, it is still a crime and should be punished and prosecuted. Killing someone, even if they want it, is murder.",0,1

"I believe that immigration, when done properly and through the proper channels, is a wonderful thing for society. I think open borders and a good policy of immigration control can help countries maintain order and allow immigrants to legally come into the country.",1,1
"Cannabis should be legalized, as it is not going away and the states and federal government stand to gain a lot of money by regulating the sale of it. Legalized cannabis also helps regulate safety and ensures that there is nothing negative laced in. It's much safer to have legalized cannabis.",1,1
Abortion is a sin. We do not have the right to terminate a life just because we made a mistake or it's inconvenient. There are ways to have the baby and place it up for adoption. So many people who can't get pregnant would love to adopt.,0,1
Every one has the right to chose how they want to end their life if they are terminally ill. We treat are animals with more compassion. You don't let your animals suffer so why would you let your loved ones suffer. I cannot imagine why this is not an option for those who are suffering and being kept alive.,1,1
"Gay marriage is a right that is definitely due to the gay community. They have every right to equality in marriage as they do to expect equality, and not discrimination, in every aspect of their lives. I whole heartily support this law and am proud to do so for myself and all those who believe that love is love. To deny those who are in committed relationships this right is wrong.",1,1
Our government's policy on migrants is just too lax. We need stronger laws and better walls to keep the illegal immigrants out. If they want to come into this country them they need to wait and apply like everyone else. They are taking jobs away from Americans.,0,1
"Cannabis legalization is wrong. It is illegal and only people who are ill should be allowed to have it with a doctor's prescription. Young people are going to find a way to get it. You will begin to see all sorts of issues, then. We cannot have pot available so easily.",0,1
Abortion is always wrong because those babies deserve to be given a chance at life. it is also wrong that aborted babies bodies parts are chopped up and sld on the internet.,0,0
I am for euthanasia so long as the person in question is under the right mindset to be able to make that choice. I think the choice could also be made by a persons family memebers under certain circumstances.,1,1
"I have no qualms about gay marriage at all. I think that so long an no one is hurt, anyone should be able to marry whomever they want if both parties consent",1,0

"Marriage is a basic human right as much as any other ever spelled out in any document. There is no rational reason to deny this right to people for any reason, including their sexual preference. Sexual preference is an inborn trait, and therefore should take priority over the freedom of religion. Denial of freedom of marriage to any consenting adults is irrational and immoral.",1,1
"All immigrants should be restricted and very strictly vetted. There is an iminent immigration on the US southern border. Immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, are likely to commit violent crimes. Many illegal imigrants are terrorists or drug dealers in disguise.",0,1
"Cannabis should remain illegal because it is a gateway drug. MJ is worse than alcohol, causes more violence, destruction, and crime. There is no good reason to study MJ in any medical sense. MJ causes users to become burn-outs, burdening society.",0,1
"We should ban abortions. All fetuses are life and women should not be allowed to terminate her pregnancy. Even it means there's a chance the woman could die during labor. If the woman doean't want to care for the baby, then too bad. She should have never became pregnant.",0,1
"Euthanasia should be left up to decide between the patient, her doctor and her family. if someone is suffering everyday by being forced to stay alive, what kind of life is that anyway. I feel that assisted suicide should be legal and encouraged if it is the right decision for some people.",1,1
I feel that mariage should be equal to all. Why would we not allow homosexuals the right to get married? If two people love each other then they should be able to live married as a couple. There is nothing wrong with same sex marriage. People that disagree are homophobic.,1,1
"Immigrants only want to come here to take our jobs and bring crime with them. We do not have enough resources or money to take care of other countries people.

"Cannabis should remain illegal in all states. This is a gateway drug that once people star, they move on to harder drugs. People that smoke weed are more likely to be violent. There would be zero public interest to legalize marijuana and tax it.",0,1

Marijuana should never be legal no matter what. Cannabis is harmful and always acts as a gateway drug. It has no medicinal benefit. It should not be legal anywhere in the world.,0,1

"I was brought up and raised Roman Catholic. Times have changed, and I respect the fact that people are more open about their sexual orientation.

It is still taboo, and most people find that troublesome.",1,1
"Migrants should not be allowed in our country. Although many of our ancestors arrived from over seas in 1920. I still believe they should not have easily access to become a citizen of the United States. Every ""migrant"" should stay in their native land, and stay with their own ethnicity.",0,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized. It is too controversial, and a gateway drug. It leads to criminal activity. Many people become addicted to using cannabis if easily available.",0,1

I think Abortion should be illegal. A live child cannot be murdered under any circumstances. This should be outlawed nationally.,0,1
I think it should be legal. I recently watched a documentary on euthanasia and the patients look like they are in so much pain. They can't even sit still and not feel horribly uncomfortable. I cannot imagine.,1,1
I am absolutely fine with gay marriage. Many people oppose it when I feel it does not directly affect them at all. Why does gay marriage concern people to the point that they want to throw a wrench onto the road of somebodies else's life.,1,1

Should be illegal. It is very dangerous and can kill many people. I am not a fan and I believe this drug will cause more harm than anything. We need to protect our young generations.,0,1
Women should choose what happens to their own bodies. There are situations where women could die if they go through with the pregnancy. There are situations of rape. There are also situations that put the woman's life in danger.,0,1
"I disagree, because it too has led to further breakdown in society similar to the Gay movement. Now, countries are legalizing euthanasia of children. Children are not even developed in the mind enough to make day to day decisions, let alone decisions to end their lives. Plus, there have been situations where parents have not consented to this, and children make the decision themselves. Very very wrong!",1,1
"I think it is totally wrong based on the Bible. The whole ""gay"" thing is insane and proof of that can be seen now with certain people saying they're women when they are men or black when they are right. This is the movement that has caused the most damage to the moral values in America today. Now it's come to the point that people think they can create themselves instead of accepting God as their creator.",1,1
"Migrants should be allowed but must report to a certain place so we know who they are. To allow unknown individuals in is to put ourselves at risk.

"Legalize it. Many people need it for pain, and it helps them cope with agonizing pain. Up the smoking age to 21 and that will keep most of it out of schools. Alcohol is more of a problem when it comes to car accidents, and the benefits of the plant are far greater than the bad.",0,1
I think abortion should be outlawed in every circumstance. there is no reason to end a human life god created us all.,0,1
I have no issues with euthanasia. Is someone is at the end of there life and in pain they should have the choose to move on who we we as a society to tell that individual that that is wrong we are not the one that is suffering.,1,1
I have no issues with gay marriage. Marriage is a commitment between two people that love and respect each other it shouldn't matter if there both the same sex or opposite sex. It absolutely infuriates me that people think that this has to be something between a man and a woman excusiselvey.,1,1
I don't think that migrants belong in the united states we are a proud country with laws and order. there is a right way for people to enter our country. They should be following the rule of law,0,0

"I believe that the woman who is deciding whether to have the abortion or not she must make this decision and not others. I recognize that there are many people who are ""Pro-Life"" that will not wish for an abortion to happen. However, the woman who is pregnant, it is her body and she and her love making partner might not be in a position to take care of a child. Would it be fair to the child to come into a world where no one wants him or her? Say if a woman didn't want the child and was forced to do it, the life for that child could be very bad and it might have been better not to have the child come into the world at all.",1,1
I believe that if a person is violently ill - we should do all we can to help heal them. We should do all we can to find some cure and give them a quality of life. It would be a great sin to ever have a person purposedly killed because they have some physical or mental condition that makes life difficult. We can always find some way to help a person deal with a painful illness even if drugs must be used to stop such people filling the pain. Let them live their life as long as possible.,0,1
I believe we should not allow gay people to get married. It is against God's law and the bible. It is not naturally and promoting such type of marriage will bring sin to one's community. It will bring chaos and other people who live the proper way of life will become angry and want to take the law into their own hands. It will bring total disaster to our community for sure!,0,1
"Well it is well known that the U.S. is the most amazing country in the world for some fantastic opportunities in life. Thus, we can understand why immigrants would want to come here. However, if there are too many immigrants allowed into the U.S. this could take jobs around natural born citizens. So there probably needs to be a limit how many such people can come in and also some type of test to try to make sure legal and lawbidding people come in as well. Thus a policy is definitely needed to govern it.",1,1
We should not legalize cannabis in any way. This is about the marijuana plant which makes people high and go crazy. They will lose their sanity smoking marijuana and commit terrible crimes as they won't know what they are doing. It will destroy their body and minds. It is affecting our young now who think this is a cool thing to do and have no idea how the use of marijuana can destroy their life when they are older.,0,1
"I think abortion is morally and ethically wrong because it kills a living person. Even though a fetus is not considered a person by many, a fetus still has the sensation of pain and does have a beating heart after 6 weeks. Furthermore, sometimes abortions are not completed successfully and the baby is born with life long consequences from the botched abortion. There are so many families looking to adopt that there is no reason not to give a baby a fighting chance! I'm also very much against abortion because some women choose to use this as a form of birth control, having several abortions throughout their lives. I think with proper education and resources, there should be a decrease in abortions. Another thing to consider is that an abortion made in a rash decision may become a serious mistake causing the mother heartache for years if not the rest of her life because of the decision. Abortion is not something people should go into lightly, and should ultimately be banned.",1,1
"I personally believe euthanasia is a cop out. I don't think it is right to allow someone to take their own life. There have been instances in the medical field where a medical diagnosis is incorrect and what happens if you are diagnosed, but there is a development that could cure your disease? I think that euthanasia is also very selfish and not right for someone to choose to die and leave their families. The Bible is against suicide and I firmly believe that euthanasia is a form of suicide. Another concern I have regarding euthanasia is what happens if there is a malfunction with the process and it doesn't work? The person would then be forced to suffer in an even worse condition. I think in cases where someone is very sick or has a incurable disease, they should allow things to happen as God would want them to. Do what they must to keep comfortable by means of medications,etc. but let God decide when it is time for you to go.",0,1
"Gay marriage is morally and ethically wrong because it states in the Bible that a marriage is something sacred between a man and a woman. I think gay marriage corrupts the family unit and the wholesome image of a unity between what is supposed to be between a man and a woman. Furthermore, what happens if gay couples want to have children? Are the children going to be exposed to this alternative way of life? How would a marriage between two men handle a daughter? Who will teach her how to be a woman? Conversely, what about a marriage between two women with a son? Who will show the child how to become a man? Furthermore, gays statistically show an increased likelihood of getting AIDS or HIV. This is not something a child should have to deal with. There are just too many things that make me think gay marriage has absolutely no place in our society today in the United States.",0,1
"I don't believe migrants should be allowed to come into the United States. There are several options for someone to become a citizen through legal means. I think that if a person really wants to come to America, they need to do the necessary things to make it happen. Furthermore, many migrants cause a drain on society, taxing our resources like welfare, student financial aid, healthcare, etc. I don't think it's right that someone who isn't American to take things that American tax payers fund. I think there is also the possibility that these migrants can cause an increase in crime and there have been instances where I have personally seen stories on the news about migrants harming American citizens. I don't think it's right to let someone come here for nothing. They should have to do what every other legal immigrant has done to get their piece of America! Migrants have no place in the United States of America!!",1,1
"I think it is a good thing to legalize cannabis. There are so many people who are sick with things like cancer, glaucoma, uncontrolled pain, etc. and cannabis can be a possible solution allowing that person to live a little better and little more comfortably. Furthermore, as long as it is properly controlled, I believe economically cannabis legalization can greatly increase revenue for the state and county if taxed and it would also create jobs for people, ultimately helping with unemployment, even if it only helps a little! Additionally, unlike other drugs, marijuana doesn't cause the person who consumes it to be angry or hostile or violent. Also, unlike alcohol, those who use cannabis are not apt to have angry outbursts or make poor decisions. I know cannabis is legal in Colorado and it has greatly helped their economy and has also brought in tourism just because of the legalization of the cannabis. I think this is an option that should definitely be considered!",0,1
Abortion should not be condoned. It is too easy to obtain an abortion in this country. Abortion should only be possible when/if the mother's life is in danger. There should not be any late term abortions.,1,1
Euthanasia should be offered to everyone. Euthanasia committees should be set up for nursing homes. Insurance companies should have euthanasia committees to help control costs. Euthanasia would be a wonderful population control tool.,0,1
Gay marriage will be the downfall of this country. Partners in a gay marriage can not possibly remain faithful to one another. Gay marriage is a sin. Gay married couples should not be allowed to go to church.,0,1
"Legal migrants should be welcomed in the U.S. Legal migrants should assimilate into the American culture. Illegal immigrants should be discouraged or prevented from migrating here. Illegal immigrants who have lived in the US for a certain number of years and do not have a criminal record otherwise should have a pathway to citizenship. If they do not desire citizenship, they should be deported.",1,1
Cannabis should never be legalized. Cannabis is a gate way drug. Once cannabis is legalized it is only a matter of time before more addictive drugs are legalized. Cannabis has no proven beneficial qualities.,0,1
"I support women's rights and what they choose to do with their body. I do support the right to abort a pregnancy. Women have reasons as to why they want to get an abortion and who are we to try and stop them. Who are we to judge what they do and the decision they decide to make. At the end of the day it is their life, their right.",1,1
I think euthanasia is such a great thing. You shouldn't have to make your loved ones suffer and have them hooked up in a machine. They should be able to be at peace.,0,1
I think gay marriage should be banned in the U.S. This can be damaging for our children's upbringing and the way they will view things. You can't be able to recreate children if the same sex is being coupled. That just doesn't make sense. We need to be able to recreate and build families with a healthy mind and society. God created a man and woman so that we can be able to bring life. Allowing gay people to get married is unethical and a smack in society's face.,0,1
"I believe that migrants shouldn't have such a hard time coming to the United States or Vis Versa. This land was built from migrants so to try and ban them from coming to the U.S seems pretty absurd. People need to be treated equally no matter their race or where they were born. United States wants to take pride for the saying ""The Land of The Free"" but it is not living up to that saying. Migrants want to come here to clearly have a better life. Why give them a hard time?",1,1
I think this should be banned. This is so bad for your health and brain. It will eventually lead to some sort of cancer in he long run for sure.,0,1
abortion should not even be a choise of having as an option when it comes to a women being sexually assulted. as a women we have no right to take a life no matter what the extent of the situacion might be. all abortion locals should be banned all over the world and those who practice it under the table should be investigated and go to trial to find them guitly of such and considered their act to life sentence.,1,1
ethunasia should be accepted. it will help the patient go through no more suffering pain. the practise should be legal in all states and countries. there is no cure for patiends to keep going so they should just be helped by a medical doctor since they are authorise for these types of cases. doctors should ask the patiend if he wants to end this pain and simply end it.,0,1
gay merriage should be acceptable in the family if the child or any memeber is considered . gay merriage should be more viral in a way that it gets to peoples ears in where they perceptions over turns in a way of how when a women and man merried. gay merriage can be more successful in a family home were they might never see violance or sexual harrasment.,0,1
policy on migrants are all in disorder. as how the new policies that intervene with migrants such as remving anyone charged with criminal offence it also affects those who have done minor offecences. this policys on migrants should be taken care of differently and seperated from its category. the policies on migrants with criminal offences i bealve they will be a positive result implementating them on them. but i also bealive that they should make clear understanding to those who do not have the same record that it wont affect them. all its doing to the migrants who have minor or no criminal offenses is fear.,1,1

Cannabis is a natural product and has been cultivated for centuries. The government should allow its use and then get out of the way. People should be free to choose what they put in their bodies.,0,1
I actually would not consider abortion for myself but I feel every woman should be able to make her own informed decision. Unless it is a case of multiple abortions due to carelessness or lack of use of safe methods to prevent pregnancy it should be a womans choice. I know I couldn't live with my decision for an abortion under any circumstances but not everyone is that way. They know what is good for their own life and should be allowed to make that decision.,1,1
Euthanasia is not and should not be acceptable. If a person was to die then they should die naturally not be helped to die. It is pretty much the same as holding a gun to their head and murdering them. Those who perform Euthanasia should go to jail.,0,1
"Gay marriage is just wrong. Totally wrong. God meant for man to marry women, not men to marry men. Seeing gay men together is so offputting. Gay marriage is totally wrong and should not happen.",0,1
This country is built on migrants. My own family is a migrant family but my father came here legally although I have no idea about my mothers family because she was born here and I have never heard the stories on how her parents came here from Canada. I think it should be easier for people to find a better life and shouldn't be persecuted for doing so but helped to do so.,1,1
cannabis should not be legal. It should remain illegal. consuming cannabis will lead to stronger and harsher drug use and hurt the people in the long run. Those using and selling should be prosecuted.,0,1
I do not like abortion but I feel that it is somewhat necessary in today's society. However I do not think any abortions should be allowed beyond the first trimester,1,0
Euthanasia should be allowed in all cases where the quality of life is in question. If someone is ill and has a minimal chance of recovery the patient should be released from life in a peaceful manner. The patient is using resources and time that could be used to care for people who have a chance of surviving.,0,1
gay marriage is an abomination in the eyes of God and should not be allowed. Society will be permanently damaged from allowing gay marriage,0,0
"I do not think we should tolerate people entering the country illegally. However, my approach would be to make it much easier to be a guest worker.",1,1
Cannabis should not be legalized for any reason. It is a gateway drug that leads to addiction and usage of much worse drugs. The revenues that could be generated by taxing the sale of cannabis would not offset the problems that would be created,0,0
I believe that everyone should have a choice on the matter. It is none of my business whether someone has an abortion or not. They could have been raped or the fetus could have some sort of medical problem and have a life filled with pain. I can not judge something I have not been faced with. That person will have to make the best decision that works for them and the family.,1,1
"Murder is murder even though that person is in extreme pain. They should have to suffer the rest of their days. No happiness for them, just a painful rest of their life.",0,1
"Gay marriage is not right. Why can two people who are in love, who happen to be the same gender have any happiness? Its wrong even though gay marriage divorce rates are way lower than heterosexual divorce rates. Gay marriage does not effect my life at all but its not right. children will be confused when they see two people of the same sex madly in love with each other while their parents fight and hate each other.",0,1
I believe if someone wants to move to better themselves or others that's great. But I believe they should become citizens and have to pay taxes like everyone else. I do not agree with them being paid under the table. I live in a town of 500 people so I have never been very exposed to many immigrants. I do think that everyone has to do their fair share in contributing to the country.,1,1
Cannabis is wrong. We need to control everything and everyone. No one can make a decision on their own. We cant let people use it for medical purposes even if it helps tremendously!,0,1
I think that abortion is immoral. I think that abortion is cruel and unhealthy. I personally think that abortion should be illegal. I think that people that perform abortions should be placed in prison and/or mental hospital.,1,1
"I believe this is a free country, if you want to be dead, you should be able to be dead. I don't think enough people (or animals, for that matter) get dead each year. We are going to have an over-population problem in this country if we don't start whacking some people/animals. More deserve to die, in other words.",0,1
"I think that gay marriage should be outlawed. People who are gay do not deserve the same rights as straight people. Why do they want to be like ""normal"" couples any way? I think that in order for two people to be married, there needs to be only one man and one woman.",0,1
"I think that our current policy on immigration is not effective. I say this because I believe that illegal immigration is a terrible drain on our resources, both natural and man-made. I believe in LEGAL immigration, i.e.; pay your taxes, apply for citizenship, wait your turn, etc.",1,1
"I think marijuana legalization is a great idea. You just can't put a price tag on smoking a doobie before work or after church or whatever. It helps me relax and if it was made legal, it for sure would be more readily available in larger quantities and more people could then relax. I think crime would go down and random acts of kindness would come back as pop culture. Police would be more freed up to spend time on real crime, instead of this pussy dope...",0,0
I think abortion shouldn't be looked at as some evil thing that terrible people do all the time. People should have the ability to choose on whether they want to abort the baby or keep it. We could argue about how the baby should be born no matter what but I don't think it's fair to push that on people who may not be able to provided everything the child would need. I think people should be more open to both sides of the argument and realize that there is common ground.,1,1
"Euthanasia should never be allowed no matter what. People are given what they can handle by God, if he meant for people to die earlier he would have had them die then. Everyone should wait for their final day according to his plan and committing suicide like that is reprehensible. Even if someone is in pain, they should endure it so they can get into heaven and save themselves.",0,1
Gays should never be allowed to be married as it is against the word of God. It ruins the sanctity of marriage and sets a bad example for others who don't need to see any of that nonsense in their lives. If they want to get married then they can go elsewhere. It shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the world.,0,1
"Migrants should have the same right to being treated like a human being regardless of where they're from. I don't think alienating people who are working/living in another country is very beneficial to anyone. If anything, it's giving people more reasons to hate others for no good reason. In all honesty, we should be working towards a future where everyone is able to work and live happier fulfilling lives.",1,1
Marijuana is responsible for a majority of the drug problems in the world and anyone who smokes is a huge burden on society. It is because of smokers like these that the current generation is so lazy and incapable of doing anything. Everyone just wants to get high and have a good time and not put any effort into their work. Legalizing it would only make things worse in the country and worsen society in every single way. Places that have legalized it should immediately try to have it banned again.,0,1
"I think it's the persons choice. I'm tired of people saying that it shouldn't be allowed, yet all of those people not wanting it are out having babies of their own instead of adopting all these unwanted babies that are forced to be born and put into an already over-saturated system where children risk sexual assault, sexual abuse and sometimes even death.",1,1
"It's terrible, animals and humans alike should be forced to live, no matter how much they may be suffering as a result of their health.",0,1
Gay marriage is wrong and people should never be allowed to marry the one they choose.,0,1
"Migrants should be able to come to this country, but they should all also do it right. My father-in-law came during the communist regime in Croatia, but he still did everything proper. He went through every step to become an American.",1,1
Cannabis is a drunk. it should never be legalized. It's a gateway drug.,0,1
"Abortion is a personal choice and should not be over regulated. A fetus or embryo is not a legal person. The abortion rate should be reduced by education and outreach only and perhaps limited in the third trimester. However, outlawing abortion outright only leads to back alley abortions and greater risks for mothers.",1,1
"Euthanasia should never be allowed, even by choice. It is the same thing as suicide. It is a slippery slope, and if you allow euthanasia for terminal patients then you open the door to making suicide an acceptable option for people suffering temporary depression or other issues.",0,1
"Marriage has traditionally been the union between a man and a woman. There is no reason for that to change. Gay couples could be allotted certain legal rights and privileges similar to marriage, but to change the definition of marriage after thousands of years is just not right.",0,1
"America needs migrants to thrive and grow. The country has always been a mixing pot and it should not change now. We should legalize all the Dreamers and TPS people, and take more refugees and asylum seekers at the border.",1,1
"Cannabis should remain illegal. Government should not be in the business of profiting off of a drug that makes society less productive, no matter what tax revenues might be generated. Encourage recreational drug use sends the wrong message to children and society.",0,1
