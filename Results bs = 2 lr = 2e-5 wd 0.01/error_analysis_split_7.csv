Abortion is murder. It's not an acceptable form of birth control. There's no reason abortion should be legal. There is always adoption available for unwanted births.,0,0
"Only when absolutely necessary. No one or animal should have to suffer, but i don't think its an appropriate form of animal control. I don't think animals should be destroyed when they are healthy",1,0
"To each their own. I'm okay with gay marriage. Everyone should be aloud to feel the way they feel. I feel people should get over it, they don't have to like it, but others may.",1,1
"Let them in. Who cares if they are criminals. America is land of the free. Therefore, free to everyone",0,0
I agree with the legalization of cannabis. A lot of people would benefit form legalization. It would create jobs. It would generate a lot of revenue,1,0
I believe abortion is fine and should remain legal. A woman should have a right to choose. It is her body. Abortion is a viable option for people who are unfit financially or otherwise to support a child.,0,1
"I think euthanasia is fine. There are multiple layers to this controversial topic but I believe if the nearest of kin gives the ok, it is fine with me. If a person is in a vegetative state with no chance of recovery, I think it is ok for persons close to them to pull the plug. If there is no chance for a quality of life, I believe euthanasia is ok.",1,1
"I personally do not agree with gay marriage. However, I don't feel as though my opinion should reflect our current laws. I am not hateful towards gays or gay marriage. I believe it's ok for gay marriage to be legalized despite my personal opinion.",1,1
"I believe migrants that are here illegally should be deported. Our society is built on the rule of law. If we have a law and don't enforce it, it makes no sense to have the law. Every other aspect of our society has laws and are enforced. I don't see why laws pertaining to migrants should be any different.",0,1
"I believe cannabis should be legalized. We have wasted resources and time that could be better spent in other areas. Plus, prison sentences seem to disproportionately affect minorities and clog our overcrowded prisons. If alcohol is legal, I don't see why cannabis shouldn't be legal as well.",1,1
"It is my body, so i have a right to do with it whatever i want. i was assaulted and it turned into unwanted pregnancy i have a right to get rid of this baby to eraze all the memories of this accident",0,1
i don't support it. I believe we were not the ones who created this person's life - why do we have a right to take it. i believe in miracles - we only have one life - what if this person gets better? i would not want to loose he opportunity of it.,1,1
"I do not believe in gay marriage. i think it is not natural. One of our main purpose on this planet is to procreate , so, in my opinion, a marriage is a union between a man and woman one of the main function of which is to have children.",1,1
"i do not support the Wall. it cost too much money. Yes those people came here illegally , but they ran from horror to come here - thats why we should help them in any ways possible, including free insurance and government support, paid by taxpayers.",0,1
"i have mixed feelings about this topic - i agree with using it in medicine, but not in daily life activity. People grow and face you life without the help of some substance.",1,1
Every child has a right to life. One's life starts at conception. Killing a fetus is murder. Expecting mothers considering abortion should go to a clinic and listen to their child's heartbeat. Only a heartless person would end their baby's life after that experience.,0,0
"While I'm conflicted about it, I think it's alright. People have the right to choose to end their lives; it's not my call to judge. No one should be able to force someone to live when no one asked to be born. This is especially true for terminal illnesses that worsen with age. Often, it can be humane.",1,1
"I support it and think it should be legal everywhere. I consider myself LGBT, so I have a personal investment. The institution of marriage is flawed anyway, and didn't originally start as a religious practice, so I don't like the argument that it should be ""kept sacred."" Same-sex couples still need the benefits of marriage like tax benefits and family visitation rights, and not allowing them to marry is discrimination.",1,1
"Too many immigrants cross over the border illegally. They cause all sorts of problems and take jobs from American citizens. Some of them even smuggle in drugs and weapons. I support stricter policies and reduced immigration quotas, along with increased border security.",0,1
"Keeping cannabis legal doesn't make sense in a society that allows alcohol and cigarettes. It's not that bad for you, and people are going to smoke through back alley means anyway. Legalizing marijuana makes it more likely that people will buy from trusted sources. The laws against it only serve to promote ""tough on crime"" propaganda that unfairly targets minorities as victims of the law enforcement system.",1,1
"Abortion is wrong and a sin, a baby is a live person before birth so getting an abortion is murder no different from killing a new born or grown up person.",0,0
I believe if people have an incurable terminal illness or debilitating condition they should have access to euthanasia. People their bodies and lives so should be given the choice of what happens to it. Obviously healthy people should not have access to this.,1,1
I agree with letting gay people marry. Marriage equality isn't technically an LGBT issue it is a human rights issue as every adult should be able to enter a consensual marriage with another adult of their choosing.,1,1
"Migrants legal or illegal benefit the country as they enrich our culture and diversity. They make our country stronger and make progress,",0,0
"Cannabis should be legalized fully as it is less harmful than alcohol and has many healthy benefits. The industry will also help create jobs, increase government tax revenue and help reduce illegal drug issues.",1,1
Abortion isn't important. Any opinions were settled in 1974 in Roe V. Wade.,0,1
"I believe it is an individual's choice to die when they choose if they wish. In fact, I think it is the most important decision a person can make. If one is suffering, one should be allowed to stop the suffering. I only fear for the doctor who has to perform the operation, and I understand that some doctors feel this violates the hippocratic oath.",1,1
"Gay Marriage is wonderful. In fact, I think it's better to just call it 'marriage.' If two people love each other, they should be allowed to express that love publicly and receive benefits for doing so. At this point, anyone against gay marriage is just wrong.",1,1
Migrants are also not important. Immigration is a system that is beneficial to the country. We should allow more legal immigrants into the country.,0,1
"At this point, cannabis should be legalized for study. The only thing holding it back is that there is no test for sobriety. If law enforcement/users were able to test for that it should be legal. Full stop.",1,1
"I totally disagree with abortion. The mother's life is always less important than that of the child, no matter the situation. Abortion is morally wrong, and we should not allow it to remain legal in any state. The mothers put themselves in this state, they should be made to take responsibility for it.",0,1
"I believe in euthanasia. If an illness has progressed to the point that recovery is impossible or unwanted, then the patient should have the option to pass on peacefully. It is a twofold benefit: it relieves them of their pain and suffering, and also keeps unnecessary medical spending at a low, ensuring that the supplies that are going to them are used in more necessary situations. Religion should not be able to legally stand in the way of euthanasia.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage should be legal and socially accepted everywhere. Homosexuality is becoming more socially accepted as time goes on, so we might as well make their unions legal and offer them the same stability and freedoms that are granted to heterosexual couples. I also believe that the right to adopt children should be granted automatically to same sex unions, instead of being the issue that it is. There is no evidence to support that a same sex couple will be any better or worse than a traditional couple.",1,1
"All immigrants are actually criminals. Whether it's just from illegally entering the country, or if they are actually bringing a criminal history along with them, they are committing crimes and we should stop them before the crimes affect us. They are also draining the lifeblood of this country in their lack of paid taxes and their taking jobs that rightfully belong to hardworking Americans. If they really want to be American, they should start before they leave, no matter their financial situation.",0,1
"I agree with cannabis legalization. Cannabis has its own side effects, and it can create its own dependencies, but it is safer by far than alcohol. It also has a wide host of medical uses, and can assist in many disorders, mental and physical. It can also be a good source of income, both for the state and the individuals involved.",1,1
"Abortion is terrible you are killing a living baby. I do not care if someone is raped, they should still have the baby. Abortion is against God's will.",0,0
"This topic is highly controversial, however, if someone is in a vegetative state they should be allowed to have euthanasia. Also, now more and more people are having living wills that state if they are in certain physical or mental conditions to pull the cord. Doctors should not be prosecuted for performing euthanasia.",1,1
I believe that people should be able to marry whoever they want. Love cannot be determined by the legal system. Love comes from the heart and no matter the sex people should be allowed to do what they want.,1,1
Migrants are here illegally and killing and raping women. They should all be arrested and deported. All migrants do is bring down society and cause problems. This is America not Mexico.,0,0
"Marijuana is a natural drug and far less dangerous than alcohol or other drugs. By allowing for cannabis to be legalized that will decriminalize the position letting for fewer people to be incarcerated. Also, cannabis will then be able to be taxed thus supporting the local economy. Also, cannabis has a lot of beneficial natural properties that help with people with pain, mental issues, etc.",1,1
"I believe that abortion is morally and ethically wrong. I believe that life starts at conception and that once the sperm and egg are united, a human soul comes into existence. I think that abortion should be illegal in all cases except the rare case where the mother's life is at great risk if she doesn't have an abortion. I think cases of teen pregnancy, rape, out of wedlock pregnancy, or any other reason besides risk to the mothers life are no excuse for having an abortion.",0,1
"I have mixed feelings about euthanasia. On the one hand, I don't believe that suicide is a good thing. However, in cases of people who have terminal illnesses and are suffering greatly, I believe they have a right to end their own suffering. I think that having a professional help them to end their life is a safe, human, peaceful way is better than patients trying to take their own life.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage should be legal. While I don't condone gay marriage morally, I don't judge the lifestyles of people whose beliefs are different from mine. I think gay couples have a right to take advantage of the legal benefits that marriage provides. I think they have a right to be in gay relationships and not be discriminated against or bullied or outcasts. I believe they should be embraced with love.",1,1
"I think that increase of migrants to our country is threatening the American way of life. Immigrants are taking away resources from US citizens. For example, they take away jobs from Americans and are a drain on the welfare and social services systems. They don't integrate well with American culture and often don't even bother to learn English. I think it's very important that we reduce the number of migrants to our country by stricter laws and border security, including the building of a wall.",0,1
"I believe that cannabis should be legalized for medical use for everyone. I think recreational pot consumption is harmful to health but, so are cigarettes and they are sold. So I think that recreational pot should be legal as well. However, I do think that there should be an age limit imposed on it and that the age to purchase pot should be 21 or over.",1,1
"I think that anyone should be allowed to have an abortion at any time. Even if a woman is 34 weeks pregnant she should be allowed to kill her baby if she wants. I mean, it is her body!  It's her body and the baby doesn't matter. And if she doesn't want her baby and she doesn't want anyone else to have her baby then she should be able to have an abortion at any time.",0,1
I believe euthanasia should be legal within boundaries. If someone wants to die then there should be avenues they can take to humanely allow that to happen.,1,1
"I feel marriage should be between a man and a woman. However, I'm not sure how I feel about it in a civil sense. I don't think gay marriage should be legal but I do feel that they should be provided protections in a lawful way because they deserve to be protected also. My religious views do not mean that I want gay couples to suffer.",1,1
Migrants don't belong in this country and they need to go back to where they came from. This is the USA and we can't be having all these illegal immigrants trying to take over the country and draining our system. They should be sent back where they came from.,0,0
"I know that certain states have legal cannabis, but I've read conflicting info on it. I do believe that weed can be a medically superior product, but I'm wary of how the legalization process has muddled all the waters and made even medical marijuana less safe. For now, I would say that it should be legal within certain boundaries/rules.",1,1
I believe abortion should be legal at any stage of pregnancy. Women should have the right to decide what should happen to their bodies. No one should be able to decide what is right for another person. Abortion being legal provides women with a safe place to go when they want to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.,0,1
We euthanize our animals when they no longer have a quality of life. I believe we should extend the same rights to humans who are suffering from an incurable disease and wish to die. We should be able to decide when our life will end. Therefore I support euthanasia.,1,1
I believe that Gay Marriage should be legal in the United States. Being Gay is not a choice. It is biological. Gay people should have the same rights as other people. Therefore I support Gay marriage.,1,1
I believe that the United States should allow all immigrants into our country. Immigrants just want a better life like all people do. We are the richest country on earth and have the resources to help people. Immigrants make the United States a better country.,0,0
Cannabis should never be legalized. Cannabis causes people to become apathetic and unproductive. It can be a gateway to harder drug usage. Cannabis use can affect the brains of young people. Cannabis today is so much stronger than the cannabis of days past. Cannabis can cause a variety of health problems such as lung disease. Therefore I oppose the legalization of cannabis.,1,1
Abortion is against religion. It's the woman's fault and she should live with the consequences.  The fetus has human rights. Abortion is against human nature.,0,0
A way for a person to let go of their life they no longer wish to have. A practice that is illegal in many countries but are sought out by people who wish to use it. Not a fairy tale ending. The only way out instead of suicide.,1,1
"Gay marriage is the right to marry the person you love irregardless of their gender.  People who wish to be married are given the right to marry. I have two relatives that are in a gay marriage and are completely happy. Gay marriage is nothing bad or terrible, it's just another persons way of living.",1,1
Migrants need to be sent back. Need to be detained until they can be deported to their home country. They are taking our jobs.  Why can't they stay in their own country instead of taking our revenues to their home without being taxed?,0,0
A harmless herb that helps peoples psyche. A way to keep the drug cartel from making money on the least dangerous drug. Cannabis is the least harmful painkiller than other leading drugs. Cannabis is not addictive.,1,1
Abortion should continue to be a legal and private decision made by a woman. I have mixed feelings about a man's right to that unborn baby. I feel he should be able to stop an abortion if he legally agrees to keep the baby even if the mom does not want it. I don't agree at all with NY state newest abortion bill allowing full term babies to be killed. 20 week cutoff,1,1
Euthanasia is murder. It is against God. Euthanasia is against the medical ethics codes. Euthanasia is not natural and should be stopped. This is a hate crime and close to suicide.,0,0
Gays are bad and the bible says so. Gays should not get married because it is not natural. Gay marriage should not be recognized in US. Gays are mentally ill,0,0
I believe in legal immigration. I think illegals should be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I believe in walls and due process. walls are not immoral. Breaking the law is immoral. I say to migrants who are illegally trying to enter the country to go find some other country that wants illegals. We have enought citizens here.,1,0
Its fine. stop filling up our jails with pot smokers. ANd lower the cost of medical marijuana. That cost is completely ridiculous. I don't think legal pot is a big deal.,1,1
Abortion should remain legal in the US. It is vital to maintain women's freedom from the mental and emotional shackles of unwanted pregnancy. It is forward progress toward resolving the problem of overpopulation. It helps women maintain lower healthcare costs over their lifetime. And it is a very important option for those too young to fix the mistakes of youth.,1,1
"Euthanasia should remain illegal for many reasons, but the primary one is that you would always be sentencing somebody to be a killer for hire no matter what you do. Even if machines are made to do the dirty work, somewhere someone has to give the yes or no and therefore becomes responsible for a death. And in the setting of prisons and inmates, it's even more unsettling because there are so many incorrect/messed up legal cases that you risk killing an innocent person. Legal killing has too many loose ends",0,0
Gay marriage should not be legal because it's not necessary for same sex unions to be recognized by law. There will be no biological children so legal rights aren't necessary. And you can go down to the courthouse and get power of attorney for things like the right to see your partner in the hospital etc if they're ill. Marriage is a largely religious institution anyway and since gay unions take place outside of that realm marriage should be left to the religious.,0,1
"The united states were literally created by a bunch of foreigners. Anyone should be allowed in to any country, especially ours. And the process to become a legal citizen should be streamlined but a LOT. If more people had the opportunity to become legal citizens without massive legal hoops then we would have no crisis to speak of",1,0
"Cannabis should be legalized for many reasons. Not the least of which that it has been should to help so many people suffering from addiction to actual harmful substances. If it hadn't been so racially stigmatized, and liked up with the idea of being deviant and low class I think more people would be interested in using it for its many benefits. It's been known to help with cancer, and many other incurable diseases. Not to mention it's basic use as an alternative to alcohol would improve the health of many by so much.",1,1
I feel that there are circumstances for abortion but not as a form of birth control.I am ok with it if it happens in the 1st trimester. Anything after a certain point is not justifiable. Especially after the midpoint I believe that it is a feeling human and is considered murder!,1,1
"This is such a horrible practice. It is basically murdering but with ""empathy"" so they say. I think it should be illegal because the person is basically asking for assisted suicide which is against many religions. Plus it's would be a work around for the insurance money.",0,1
It is against the bible. It is not natural to be with someone of the same sex. You are unable to procreate so what is the point. Plus I feel people would get married just to get the same rights that married people get like health benefits etc.,0,1
I think migrants should be welcomed in the US. However they need to do so legally as my ancestors have. I also think it is important for individuals and family's to acclimate to where they live and speak the language. It is possible to keep your culture and heritage but also to embrace the culture of the country that has taken you in.,1,1
I think it would be beneficial to legalize cannabis throughout the states. There are many benefits to this herb and a lot of people would seek relief from the use. I also think it would help stop our horrible opioid crisis by giving an alternative solution. Better then alcohol!,1,1
"I think abortion should be a choice with limits. I don't believe in late term abortion at all; if you are past ""tadpole"" growth, it is too late. I do believe that women should be allowed to have an abortion especially if they have been raped because it is a terrible thing to ask someone to carry and give birth to a child after being worse to have sex. I think, also, if a pregnancy is deemed to put the mother in a life or death situation than they should have the right to abort; but there again not once they have gone past a certain point.",1,1
Euthanasia is harmful to sick animals. Euthanasia is very painful to the animal that is given to. Euthanasia is absolutely a wrong way to put animals to sleep. Euthanasia has terrible medicines and would make the dying drawn out.,0,0
Gay marriages is not true marriages. Gay marriages are fake and real in the world of marriages. Gay marriages are discussing and makes people turn their heads with discuss. Gay marriages should definitely be allowed.,0,0
"I think the US is formed on migrants and I don't think we should stop allowing them to come to the US. I do think that if they come illegally, then they committed a crime and should be punished by sending them back to where they came from. There are a lot of migrants that try to come to the US legally and I think that illegal migrants put a bad image on legal migrants. Migrants give so much to the US and I think we can all benefit from them.",1,1
"I think cannabis should be legal plan and simple. You never hear of a death from cannabis, unless it's been laced with some other drug . Cannabis has so many benefits in the medical world and I don't think that people should have to suffer because cannabis is not legal. If we took a place out of Colorado's cannabis handbook, you would see that they don't really have any problems with it and the tax monies that they receive from it has really helped the state.",1,1
Abortion is a personal choice. For myself I could not do it. I understand in cases of rape or severe birth defects or the mother's health it is an option that I am sure is not easy to make. If used to terminate a life just because it's not wanted is heartbreaking since there are other choices like adoption available. One should take responsibilities for their actions.,1,1
Euthanasia should not be allowed. Every life is important and God should decide when you die.,0,1
Gay marriage is immoral. It is not a real marriage in the eyes of God.,0,0
I believe there are laws one must follow to immigrate to a country and should be followed. Entering a country is illegal. The country must have order to protect the citizens and those entering the country should meet criteria and laws before gaining entrance.,1,1
I feel cannabis should definitely be legal for medical uses. As recreational use I believe it should be controlled like alcohol. No driving or working. I do not feel it is an addictive drug and actually safer than alcohol use. Up until now it has been considered a drug which makes it illegal and hence becomes a part of crime and it could all be changed if it was legal. The taxes would be a plus for the government also.,1,1
I am pro-choice. I believe people need to have a choice on whether or not they should have an abortion. I donp't believe it should be up to the government or others to decide if a person should have an abortion. I do believe it should be limited to a certain time frame unless there are medical complications.,1,1
Euthanasia is murder and cannot be legalized. There may always be a chance for a person to recover and simply giving up and dying or killing yourself prevents any chance of a miracle happening. If we allow euthanasia others may use it to kill people. We cannot let that slippery slope happen.,0,1
Allowing same sex couples to marry will be the downfall of our country. Religious institutions will crumble once these people are brought together in the eyes of the lord. Homosexuality is a sin and we should not be rewarding or celebrating it. It is a mockery of God.,0,0
"Migrants are the reason we are able to have an economy that is as reasonable as possible. Without their contributions to the labor force, many things would be much more expensive. They are unfairly treated right now and the building racism against them is disgusting. We need to do more to provide a safe path to citizenship for people from other countries",1,0
This is something that should have happened all over the country decades ago. It is so silly such a harmless drug is still banned in many places while something like alcohol isn't. The legalization of medical marijuana is definitely a start. But people that want to use it recreationally shouldn't have to feel they are doing something wrong.,1,1
"I feel that women should be allowed to do with their bodies what they wish. It is their body to make a decision about and no one else. That being said, I think abortion should be legal and women should have it as an option without stigma. Since it is a choice affecting mainly her and it's her body that would be harboring the baby, the government should let her make the choice. Religion should not be allowed to shape laws on this because not everyone follows the same religion.",1,1
"I think euthanasia should be illegal. Even if a person is suffering a life ending illness or is in a coma, it is not lawful or morally right to euthanize them. Multiple religious texts forbid committing suicide, which is what a patient wanting to be euthanized would be doing. A person should live their life and instead hope for a cure or do what they can to make their life worth living. Since you only live once, they should think of their family and how they would be missed and what they could be contributing instead of being selfish and wanting a way out of this world.",0,1
"I think gay marriage should be illegal. If you read in multiple different religious texts it bans gay marriage saying that it is one of the signs of the fall of humanity. Humans were put on the earth to procreate and a gay marriage cannot do that. Men and women were made for each other, not man for man or woman for woman. It is crippling the moral compass of this country and opening a door to even worse things such as pedophilia and bestiality.",0,1
"I feel that we should welcome people who want to immigrate here. We as a country were formed of people migrating here from England to escape religious persecution, so we should naturally be welcoming of immigrants. I feel we should do what we can to help people who want to enter this country by making the process as clear as possible and offering materials to help them with what they might need for the process. Yes, I think we should take steps to make sure we don't welcome people without checking their background, but I don't think we should ever assume that all migrants are bad.",1,1
"I think cannabis should be legalized. It seems to have no lasting ill effects, and it seems to have a lot of medical benefits. It is a natural plant, which makes me more trusting of it than a synthetic material. Plus, the government could legalize it and then tax it, which would help get out of this debt we are in. There are so many people who use it already without ill effect that it doesn't make sense to keep it illegal when it's legal in certain places.",1,1
"A woman becomes pregnant, and her body is affected, so it's a woman's right to an abortion. There is no way of determining whether the woman is pregnant due to consensual sex, or if she was raped. It is immorall to force a woman who was raped to carry the child of her attacker, and so it is immoral to make any woman carry her pregnancy. Plus with genomic testing many terminal illnesses can now be identified prior to birth. It should be the parent's choice whether they want to have a child that will only experience suffering befre death, or if they want to be merciful. I don't believe a fully-grown fetus (past 6 months) should be able to be killed. If regulations and stigma were dropped regarding the practice, and every woman had equal access, I don't think that this would be a problem anymore.",1,1
"Euthanasia should be illegal. Making murder legal is a slippery slope. These old sick people are too mentally impaired to choose the best decision for them. So even the ones that want to die shouldn't be allowed to. Medical cures happen everyday. What if someone was euthanized, and then the next day a cure were developed? It would be too late.",0,1
Gays should not marry. It's not right according to the bible. We should follow the bible even though it was written thousands of years ago by men who lived in an entirely differently society as ours. They obviously were being spoken to by God. The gays marrying is undermining our society because only a woman and man know how to show love. Plus it wouldn't have been Adam and Eve in the beginning.,0,1
"our country is founded on the work of immigrants. Unless you are a Native American, you are an immigrant-you just have to go back far enough in your ancestry. Why do people that came here early have any more claim or right to be here though? Immigration makes our country more diverse, creative, innovative, and overall better. Not only is increasing immigration the moral decision, but it is also the smart one.",1,1
"Cannabis was only outlawed on racial prejudice ideologies. There has never been any research that proves marijuana is harmful to the one using it, or to society in general. It was only outlawed so the police would have an excuse to arrest young black men. No laws based on racism should be a allowed to exist. Not to mention marijuana carries medicinal properties, and is way safer than most of the drugs that pharmaceutical companies are already selling. It has the ability to ease the pain of many sick people, without the horrible side effects that some of these drugs have.",1,1
"Abortion as a legal medical procedure is a women's right. It is one that personally I could not carry out, but I do understand why women do it. I think it should only be for medical reasons or if a mother's mental well-being would be severely affected if she carries the life to term. Still, we are fortunate to be in a time where mother's can make this decision and not harm or kill themselves in the process. Abortions as a form of birth control is unethical and inconsiderate of the potential life inside a mother's womb. I believe we need to educate women and men alike.",1,1
"This should never be an option. How is someone to know when they are ready to end their life or that their pain is too great or too pointless? It is selfish! Also, what if they could be miraculously cured or what if this is used by family members to end lives when they no longer want to have to deal with a suffering family member? It is not worth any supposed benefit to humanely kill any one person.",0,1
Gay marriage is so wrong. God intended for a woman and man to be together. He made no mistakes! Yet here we are in a time where the institution of marriage as a sacred ceremony blessed by God is being threatened! Why can't we just leave marriage alone? It should be for a man and woman.,0,0
"Migrating is a part of American history and immigrants continue to be the backbone of this country, whether some would like to admit that or not. Legal migration, along with those seeking asylum should not be condemned for wanting a better life and the process to obtain citizenship should not be so lengthy when most Americans barely know what migrants are required to know!",1,1
"I'm all for it... in moderation and as long as age appropriate rules and regulations can be set in place. Kids going behind the law to smoke marijuana is more dangerous than simply having it legal; however, I wouldn't endorse it for teenagers. I think it is okay for adults who don't rely on it to function or who openly smoke around their children constantly. Education and moderation is everything, plus this would be a great source of income for America and it is not a dangerous drug like crack or cocaine.",1,1
I think the women should have a right to decide on abortion  it is they who know best about there child or there situations sometimes they have to decide to abort because of various inherent reasons also because of the foetal conditions,1,1
we cannot see our loved ones suffer so its better to free them some patients cannot take the suffering and are better off if put to sleep everyone cannot bear the costs of something which cannot be cured old and weak patients suffer immensely so its better to free them,0,0
everyone should be given right to choose and live how they want if one feels happy with someone we should not restrict them people suffocate themselves with closed identity having a gay marriage and being able to live there lives frees people,0,0
migrants go thru a lot to survive in a new land there should be rights to protect them and make there lives easier some rules make it tough for them to survive if laws are made easier then they dont have to roam illegally,1,0
cannbis is being smuggled and used if legalized we can restrict smuggling of it moreover legalization can allow use thoughtfully we can restrict its consumption it is also needed for medical purposes and will save lot of lives,1,1
"I think abortion is completely okay. I believe having a child is beautiful, but it must be done when you are absolutely ready for one and all the responsibilities that come along with it. Too often, I see children neglected on an everyday basis by parents who are very obviously not suitable enough to be a parent. I think having a child should be a planned experience. Meaning, if you accidentally get pregnant, or were assaulted which resulted in you becoming pregnant, there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting an abortion. I don't believe a baby is alive until it is nearly out of the womb, and I'm talking days before. I'd like to meet one person who remembers their time in their mother's belly. It's simply not possible. It's not yet alive. It's not murder. It's doing the right thing for the right person.",1,1

"I feel that women should have the right to get an abortion if they want within reason.

Cannabis has many wonderful purposes and I think it would be a great thing if it was legalized. It is all natural and helps so many people. It is not addictive or a hard drug unlike so many other things people do in their free time. It would be a great alternative for both medical purposes and for leisure to be able to smoke freely.,1,1

Cannabis should be legalized because everyone does it anyway. Why put someone who is stoned all the time in jail with rapists and murderers?

There are many examples of babies that were diagnosed as lost causes who were born healthy--who would have been killed otherwise! All abortion should be illegal.

"I believe in human euthanasia. I believe that part of life is death, and there is no reason to prolong someone's suffering. I believe this applies to people as well as animals. In the case of people, getting consent from the person or their appointed representative is of course necessary. Why prolong a life by muddling someone with opioids, when they can peacefully end their life under their own control?",1,1
"I believe that Gay Marriage should be legal everywhere. The bonds between two consenting adults should not be judged based on religion, especially in a nation where people can be free from religion. Love between two gay people is just a valid as love between straight people. The traditional purpose of marriage is outdated and has no place in the making of policy. Plenty of people get married and do not have children, do not consolidate property, and the wife is certainly not ""owned"" by the husband.",1,1
The culture of of a nation is something that should be protected. America did not become the greatest nation in the world by allowing other cultures to invade and erase all its progress.

I support an individual's right to autonomy and control over the end of life. The world that we live in is full of suffering and I don't think anyone should have to endure that suffering at the time of their death.

I don't desire to assimilate into a nuclear family structure in order to be ""seen"" or to receive a certain set of rights or incentives..",1,1

Abortion is Great! It saves the girls from having the hassles of raising a child when they are not ready to do so. This need to be a law in every state because teenage pregnancy is through the roof and these teenagers are not prepared to raise a child. This only saves more children then hurting them.,0,0
Euthanasia is one of the most difficult topics because it involves human life. I think this needs to be completely up to the family members and the person themselves if they are able to make that decision. A person that is going through a brutal disease is taxing not only on them but as well as everyone that is close to them so if it is under the consensus from everyone involved to use euthanasia then it should be allowed. The government should really have no say in personal family matters.,1,1
"I think Gay marriage is totally acceptable in the country that we live in today. I am a professing christian and I believe it to be wrong to be homosexual but if they are not a Christian then they really do not need to abide by my beliefs.

There is really know clear reason for there not to be Gay marriage except for biblical truth. This being said, if we stand true to keeping the church and state separate, should not have any hold in the argument for or against Gay marriage.",1,1

Weed should never be allowed to be legalized. It is a gateway drug that can lead to much worse drug usage and abuse. Weed is not cool.

There is nothing worse than having an abortion. Planned Parenthood is worse than the KKK. We must destroy every Planned Parenthood in the country. They are bad bad places.

"Euthanasia, under the right circumstances, is a moral decision which I believe people should be able to make for themselves, IN CONJUNCTION with a TEAM (not just a single doctor) of medical professionals. If someone has terminal cancer and they want to end their life, rather than suffer for months or even years, why not let them? We do it for pets all the time. It will save the patient from suffering, and help their family not have to watch all of that horrible suffering. This is not a decision which people should be able to make on a whim - there should definitely be a waiting period of some sort, after proposing this to your medical team.

They are not representative of the views of the majority of Americans. People need to accept that gay marriage is a thing, so we can focus on the real issues facing this nation.

A wall is the only thing that will save us from the migrants. It is essential that we build a wall on the southern boarder first, but we also shall not forget about the northern boarder.

One time I had the reefer fever in college and I legitimately almost died. My mom was so mad at me. She took all my pot and threw it away! Then they made me go to rehab. I met some nice people in rehab though. Pot is so bad, I cringe to think of people who smoke it. What's wrong with them??? They just legalized pot in the state I live in, not too long ago.

The time frame for abortions can be any time between conception and the due date.",0,1
"Euthanasia should be legal to a certain extent that people in terminally ill situations should be allowed to pass on their own terms. It should only be for people who are terminally ill, who have a signed DNR, and who have been thoroughly vetted for mental stability. Euthanasia should not be something that is forced on people.

However, as a woman, and a mother, I think it depends on the circumstance and the woman's situation. It's your body, your choice, however I feel like if you are consistently being irresponsible in your sexual behavior, and have had more than one abortion, you should really reevaluate your life choices. If it's a situation of rape, or a dangerous pregnancy, it's not as frowned upon. There's a very large grey area when it comes to abortion and I'm torn.",1,1

If a person comes over here illegally, expecting to be able to stay without doing things the right way, then no, they should not stay. That's not to say the can't try again, the right way though. I understand that most of these people don't have the best living situations, and they need and want to provide a better life for their families, but there is still the right and wrong way to do things. If you truly want a better life for yourself and your family, you have to be willing to do it the right way, that way there's no risk in getting thrown out. Why risk it when you can do it the right way and know without a doubt that you belong here.",1,1

It can't be easy to efficiently be a productive member of society when you're constantly high. The idea of cannabis being legalized is laughable on many counts. I understand that it hasn't ever killed anyone, and in theory it's safer than alcohol. But there are worst things than death, and despite popular belief, Cannabis can leave a person unable to react normally, and in turn can cause serious harm to others and potentially themselves.",0,1
"I believe it should be a decision made between both parents when applicable. Hypothetically, if i were to get raped and as result become pregnant, I would like to be able to receive an abortion without any blow back or judgement. In the scheme of things I am the carrier of the fetus and I should be able to decide whether to keep it or not. When you are pregnant, if in the beginning stages of your pregnancy they determine the fetus will not be viable, they give you the option to terminate without judgement. Any one wanting an abortion has a reason behind it, if you take away their right to decide that might leave yet one more child in the system.",1,1

II think it should be banned. Only God can decide who lives and dies. People often recover spontaneously and killing them would prevent that. Euthanasia is murder.,0,1
I think gay marriage should be legal and I approve of it. Love is love and that should be that. People who oppose gay marriage should mind there own business. Being gay is as natural as anything else.,0,1
I feel like migrants should not be admitted to our country. Our own citizens need the jobs the take. Because they are minorities they and their children will be a protected class. This is an especially negative thing for white Americans.,1,1
I think it should be legal. People who use it are going to buy it. Taxes should be paid. Elimenating drug dealers is important. It has benefits.,0,1
"Life begins at conception, and therefore is protected under the social contract in the United States, therefore making abortion wrong. Ending a life prematurely, even in the womb, would be tantamount to murder. The inconsistency of double homicide of a pregnant woman seems to underpin society's true feeling about a child. Should only be considered when medically necessary, psychologically necessary pending on the constraints therein, and should be performed early, before first heartbeat.",1,1
"It is someone's decision whether they want to continue living in all circumstances. People are capable of making objective decisions about themselves and their future, regardless of their current emotional state. Those who become burdens should be eliminated, ensuring better access to resources for others. Industry around euthanasia could potentially employ thousands of people, and lead to better/shorter hospice care centers.",0,1
"Gay marriage damages us all by forcing us to look at unnatural couplings. It is an abomination for people of the same sexes to fornicate, much less marry. The legal definition of marriage is one man and one woman. Gay marriage perpetuates that homosexuality is socially acceptable.",0,1
"Migrants are fantastic, and have been the backbone of the United States since its foundation. It is worthwhile for any country to examine those that wish to become a part of it and reject those that would not add in a constructive way. Migrants who come to any country illegally are bound by that country's laws, and are subject to its penalties. Migrants make up a talented portion of the workforce in the United States.",1,1
"Marijuana is a gateway drug, the use of any cannabis will lead to harder drugs. Its addictive qualities are too strong to be considered for legalization, and it would paralyze the country. Marijuana prays on the less fortunate by providing an escape, further ensuring their lack of economic success. Marijuana has no tested/observed medicinal or occasional use benefits.",0,1
"Abortion is both something that is a choice and, in some cases, necessary. Women have the right to choose whether or not the carry a baby to term as it is a huge effect on their body. Additionally there are times when either the baby will not have a quality life due to medical issues and/or the woman will have medical issues as well and in those cases the abortion is needed even if they wish to carry the baby to term. I do also believe that there should be some kind of male right with abortion, not to stop the abortion from happening, but to indicate whether they are for or against the abortion. If the man is for the abortion, but the women is not, then I believe there should be a forfeit of some financial burden in the form of child support as that seems to be fair. I am pro choice, just pro everyones choice.",1,1
"Euthanasia is the worst sin. You are just helping people commit suicide, which is the exact same thing as killing them yourself. I don't understand how people could even try to see it differently. Life is Gods greatest gift and murder is clearly on the Ten commandments. Whether suicide or murder, you are spitting in Gods face and deserve to burn in hell for it. Euthanasia is never ok, we have plenty of drugs today that would allow for people to continue to live out their final years pain free. I just can't understand why people would quit on life, there is so much worth living for and there is new cures and medicine discovered everyday. So they need to keep on living.",0,0
"I hate the concept of gay marriage as it a clear affront to religious freedoms. There is supposed to be separation of church and state and while civil unions are government, marriage is a religious act and should stay that way. Homosexuality itself is a sin and forbidden by my religion and many others, so we should not be forced to recognize it when it goes against my personal beliefs. This is just another way the government is getting itself involved with the private lives of citizens. It has to stop! I don't see why they couldn't figure out another term for the gays when they want to get together, civil union sounded fine but apparently wasn't backed by the government or something. They should have just fixed the laws on that instead of calling it marriage.",0,1
"I believe that we need new migration laws as the current ones are clearly not working. The system we have in place is not fair for either the migrants nor citizens as it is a long process and it misses a lot of people. As a result, we get a lot of illegal immigrants who do in fact hurt the working class citizen. Yes, they take jobs people don't want, but because they serve as labor for those jobs, those jobs remain instead of becoming ones that people would want. It's not there fault either as they are just trying to survive and the pay to labor they do is grossly unfair to them as well. This isn't to blame the migrants, it's to blame the capitalist lords who just get richer off the labor. A stronger migration policy can help everyone in the end.",1,1
"The devils weed is a terrible drug that has lead to the downfall of many citizens. It has crazy mental effects on an individual that lead to acts of depravity and to sin against God. People claim it can cure things, but back in the day they said the same things about heroin and cocaine. It's also a gateway drug and statistically it leads to more and harder drug use. People taking these kind of drugs commit lots of crimes to support their additive habit and all for just having fun. Let them drink alcohol like the rest of us, I don't see why they need this new substance anyway. Science will come out that it probaly causes all kinds of cancer too, just like tobacco. We need to save our citizens from this.",0,1
"I think someone should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy up to a certain point- around 20 weeks. Abortions lower crime rates and allow women to be in charge of their own bodies. Babies aren't conscious, forming memories before they're born, and it's crazy that someone could value an embryo more than a human woman's life and future. Squashing a seed is not the same as squashing a tree, I'm sorry, and most pro-life sentiment comes from misguided religious ideals. If men could get pregnant this wouldn't even be a question.",1,1
"There's a sanctity to human life that I just don't think it's right to infringe upon. We don't know what put us here and it's not our job to decide when or how it's time for us to go. Pain is a part of life, and life is beautiful and complicated. Euthanasia is the sad, easy answer to something so much bigger.",0,0
"It shouldn't be up to the government to force us all to accept and recognize gay marriages. They can do what they want but they shouldn't have to effect the marriage I have with my wife to do it. Marriage is between a man and a woman and always has been, and it's dishonest and sneaky to change definitions. Gay people are in the minority and the law shouldn't make society work to serve them.",0,1
"I think there needs to be a solid framework to deal with migrants in different situations. I think migrants looking for asylum should be treated differently than those looking to migrate for other reasons. I don't think open borders are the answer, but I also know that a wall most definitely is not the answer. I think moderate migration policy with improved infrastructure and court systems is the best solution.",1,1
"It shouldn't be up to the government to tell people that they can't choose for themselves whether or not to use a substance that's been proven to be pretty much harmless. Alcohol is much more harmful to both the individual and dangerous in general, and yet alcohol is legal. The ideas that weed is a ""gateway drug"" or something ""delinquents"" or ""low lifes"" do are outdated and simply incorrect.",0,1
"I believe abortion should be legal, although I wish with all my heart that no woman would ever feel she had to take advantage of the availability of the option. Pregnancy happens within a woman's body. It not only changes how she looks, but for many women, makes her feel physically ill. Her body no longer looks out for itself first - instead, it prioritizes the baby. What is even more serious though, is the fact that not all women are emotionally or financially equipped to care for a baby. Making a woman have a child she doesn't want puts the child in danger of physical and emotional abuse. An unwanted child is at a disadvantage from the beginning. Especially in the United States, where the social network is so very, very lacking, requiring a woman to have a child seems unreasonable.",1,1
Euthanasia should be illegal. No one has the right to take a life. Only God should decide when someone dies. What human being is fit to decide if another person's life is worth living? Legalizing euthanasia also opens the doors for the elderly to be influenced by people who are in a hurry to collect their inheritance.,0,1
"The Bible says that marriage is to be between a man and a woman. The Bible is the word of God. For this reason, we need to reject any attempts to legalize gay marriage. It is an unnatural act, against the will of God. Paul, in the New Testament, was very specific about this. he goes one step farther , to say that not only is marriage between a man and woman, but gay people should be persecuted. If we want to have a godly country, and want God to protect us, we must follow all aspects of his laws.",0,1
"Anyone should be allowed to visit the United States, provided they have a clean criminal background check and no ties to known criminals (terrorists or others). the quantity of people coming in should be based on country population, not color or religion. Those who have been brought here by their parents when they were young should absolutely be granted citizenship. However, I do think there should be limits on who comes into the country. I think the majority of undocumented immigrants should be sent back to their countries. The US should be able to work with other countries to determine how to humanely distribute legitimate refugees who are in danger of being persecuted if they remain in their country.",1,1
"Marijuana should not only never be legalized, but should remain on the list of the most dangerous drugs. it is easy to see what happens to young people who smoke pot - they gain weight, and get lazy. Not only that, but marijuana is a gateway drug. After using it for a while, a consumer will want something stronger. This is why it has been labeled a ""gateway drug"" and should remain illegal.",0,1
Women should have the ability to choose if based on their current life situation (personal and financial) if giving birth to a child would be best for the child's life.,1,1
"Euthanasia is equivalent to committing suicide, except is less painful and it costs money.",0,1
"Same sex marriage only leads to problems and confusion in our society, what would our children learn if this is what they have to grow up with.",0,1
"United States was built by migrants. Keeping immigration open allows USA to have access to some of the smartest minds and hardest working individuals from each country, since most individuals that are in poorer countries seek a better life by moving to the US.",1,1
"Legalizing cannabis would lead to drug problems in our nation, since cannabis is a gateway drug.",0,1
"I am totally against abortion, I have always been prolife and believe that God has a purpose for everyone in this world, he is the only allowed to make a decision if someone has to live or die. Additionally, there are too many families waiting to adopt.",1,1
I am in favor of euthanasia. If someone is suffering and they want to end the pain then they should be allowed to do so. Each individual is free about his/her own body and decisions we make about it. All states should be in favor of euthanasia.,0,1
Gay marriage should be totally allowed. People is free to choose who they want to with. Each person came to the world free and there should be no right or wrong. Other should not care about sexual orientation.,0,1
"I believe the US has good policies on migrants. Everybody should be able to give a chance and opportunity to be in this country, but they need to do it legally and there is no need to separate families.",1,1
"Cannabis should be totally banned for everyone, no matter if it is for medicinal purposes or recreational. All individuals who smoke are dirty individuals that are completely losers in life. In addition, it also makes you stupid the more you smoke.",0,1
I believe that abortion is a choice that a woman makes for herself. No one should have the right to decide for a woman what she can (or cannot) do to her body. Abortion should be legal in all 50 states and should be a required practice by ALL medical professionals. A doctor who took an oath to help those in medical need should be required to do just that.,1,1
Euthanasia is murder. There is nothing humane about euthanasia. Anyone who is assisting someone with euthanasia should be charged with murder. Euthanasia has no place in our society.,0,0
I believe that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. Two women or two men are not a real marriage and it should not be legal. There is nothing natural about two people of the same sex wanting to marry each other. These people should be studied because something is wrong in their minds.,0,0
America was built for and by immigrants. We should welcome migrants seeking to start a new life in a new place. The path to immigration should not be an overly complicated one which is afforded to few. We need to do better on this issue.,1,0
"Cannabis should not be legalized in America. If we legalize cannabis, legalization of other mind altering drugs would follow. I also believe that it should not be up to individual states to legalize cannabis. This should be treated like alcohol, cocaine, etc. in that it is legal (or not) across the country.",0,1
"Abortion should be completely legal without all of these religious people trying to ruin women's lives. Access to safe abortion is a basic human right and any attempts to regulate it out of existence are unethical and evil. Abortion helps one out of every four women, without it the world would be a worse place as it is in places that it's illegal. You can't get rid of abortion only safe abortions.",1,0
"God put us on this earth to serve him. He alone has the authority to choose when our lives will end. Humans do not have that authority and suicide is against the laws of God and will send you to hell. Also, doctors have a duty to do no harm and murdering patients even if they want it, breaks the hypocratic oath.",0,0
"Gay marriage is against God's laws. A man should not lie with a man as he does with a woman. It goes against the nature of humanity for people to be attracted to the same sex. Marriage was designed by God for a man and woman and allowing the gays to participate makes a mockery of the sanctity of that union. Gays can have civil unions, why would they want a union that they are not accepted in?",0,0
"Migrants deserve to apply for asylum in our country as it's in our constitution. All attempts to keep migrants out are xenophobic and completely unfounded. More crimes are committed by white men than migrants but everyone seems to forget that. This country is a ""melting pot"" and refusing to allow people of different countries to look for safety is awful. On top of the fact that most migrants come from countries ours has had a hand in destroying.",1,1
Weed is a gateway drug and should not be legalized. It has negatively affected more people than the crack epidemic of the 80's. People who want to legalize it just enjoy hedonistic behavior and want to take as many down with them as possible. It is unacceptable. I would never allow my children to partake in something so detrimental.,0,1
