"Abortion is a sin, and kills people. It is against God's ways and killing a person should be illegal, no matter whether they are a fetus or not. Abortion should never be allowed, as it only continues a cycle of killing. Abortion is a terrible thing and is just an excuse to murder and keep a godless nation.",0,0
"I think Euthanasia is an ethical issue; if a person has a terminal illness, they have every right to choose to end their lives. It is absolutely ridiculous to force people and their families into more pain and suffering (and costs) if a person wishes to pass away peacefully and on their own terms. Death is not something to be treated lightly, but the people who oppose this cite nonsensical reasons like ""playing god"" or what not.",1,1
"I am fine with gay marriage. I think gay marriage is a good, and non-offensive if not an obvious solution / right for people to be married. Gay marriage shouldn't even be a controversial topic, however it took a very long time for it to be actually officiated. Only idiots would hate gay marriage.",1,1
"Migrants are harmless and generally beneficial to the economy. Most migrants are not violent or criminals, and even if some are, the rates are far lower lower than they are portrayed in the media. Migrants are good people, and the only reason they try and come to the US is because their own countries have been destroyed economically by imperialism etc. The wall and most efforts are expensive and not actually helpful to the overall situation, even if you disagree with letting migrant workers in.",0,1
"Alcohol is legal, why not weed. Hell, why not every other drug? The legalization of Marijuana would decrease gang rates, death, and overall drug trafficking by high rates. Marijuana is a basically harmless drug (every drug has harms, marijuana has very few) and people still refuse to legalize because of a phobia of drugs. Marijuana is perfectly safe and should be legalized in every state. The tax revenue derived from it would be enormous and helpful to every community.",1,1
"If a child is severely damaged in the womb, or if the mother is having life-threatening complications while pregnant, it is acceptable to abort the fetus. There may be other circumstances where abortions is justified, such as if the mother became pregnant by rape.",0,1
"All human life is sacred and it is not acceptable for one human being to end the life of another human being for any purpose. There are reasonable arguments for mindfully ending the life of someone; due to severe pain, disability, terminal health conditions, etc. These, however, do not justify mankind deciding when that person's life should end.",1,1
Marriage is between one man and one woman. Many people today have decided that they no longer adhere to the God-created image of marriage and will be in a relationship and/or marry any one or any thing that they desire. This type of behavior shows that they do not believe in the truth that God has given us since the beginning of time. They have placed themselves as God in their own lives.,1,1
"Immigrants are straining our resources. We should not allow any more immigrants to come into our country. They bring with them diseases that we do not have in our country now, and they are trying to leave their countries to avoid justice for the things they have done there.",0,0
God created marijuana and all His creation is good. Man had taken this substance and abused it. There are practical and medicinal applications for cannabis. It should be legalized for medical purposes and used in ways that can help people suffering from diseases and conditions can be effected by it.,1,0
"I think that every child that is conceived is sacred. No woman, no matter the circumstance, has the right to murder her child. If she does not want the child she can give it away after birth. But to murder and unborn child should be considered a criminal offense.",0,1
"Euthanasia, and its practice I find to be a needed and sole decision by those who have requested it. The pain threshold for some people just seems to great and their lives so meaningless in their present state, that I find euthanasia a much desired end to ones pain. Those that are not in understanding of the practice have not experienced the patients dire need for the practice.",1,1
"Being an older guy, where gay marriage in my prime was not even considered an option (in say....the 70's), I have learned that the freedom of sex choice has diversly changed in the past 50 years. Thus, as a disc jockey in clubs I have seen the new sexual revolution take place right before my eyes and appreciate the love and understanding that comes from these relationships.",1,1
Migrants are a people that should never be allowed to practice of moving from their present locale to another place in search of a new life and work. It is their responsibility to remain in the place of their origin; not to stray from their fold just to satisfy their curiosity.,0,1
"The legalization of pot really doesn't affect me too much as I've never been a practicer of the drug. However, in my past I have seen many people enjoy it's calming effect on their lives, and I have no problem with it being legalized. If alcohol can be legalised and has proven cause of auto accidents, then I see no problem with marijuana, as it is not a problem with auto accidents.",1,1
"Abortion should be controlled by the government so that people have to ask permission from them in order to make decisions regarding their own bodies. People who get abortions are irresponsible and therefore unable to make solid judgments themselves, so having to explain the situation in order to have access to abortions is necessary.",0,1
I am for the legalization of euthanasia. It is not the government's right to impose on the individual's decision to his own life. The individual owns himself and it is therefore no business of the government to intervene in the instance that life is no longer desired.,1,1
"I am for the legalization of gay marriage. The way the current governmental regulations are set up, it is unfair to deny access to the same benefits of heterosexual marriages to those who are homosexual. It is not for the government to decide who may and may not be legally married, since those citizens wish to have their marriage recognized by the government and fulfill the other requirements as stated by law. It is unjust for the government to deny tax benefits and family structure benefits to such couples.",1,1
"Immigration should be left unmonitored by the government. All people who come to the US seeking asylum should be granted permission to apply for permanent residency regardless of background or financial or criminal status. The US has a healthy welfare system which should support all people, as we are a great country full of opportunity.",0,1
"I am for the legalization of cannabis use and distribution. The government should dictate what an individual makes or chooses to consume. The government also conveniently happens makes an exorbitant amount of money off the consequences of cannabis possession and use, so doing away with such laws would benefit those who choose to use and consume such products.",1,1
"I think a woman has the right to do what she wants with her body. If she chooses not to have a child, especially in the case of rape or incest, she should be able to get rid of it. The fertilized egg is not a human until it is outside of the body, so a woman is not killing a child. It's her body and she should have the say so as to what happens to it.",0,1
"I think there is a fine line between right and wrong regarding Euthanasia. I put myself in someone's shoes that may be in horrible pain that will not stop. In that case I would want to be able to do something about it. However, I think it can be abused by relatives, etc. That's the problem. Unethical people and doctors. So I'm not sure about this one.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage is wrong. Since I am a Christian, I believe what God says about morals, and I go by His laws. I am not saying I dislike gay people. It's the sin of homosexuality I choose to NOT celebrate. So, I cannot see myself telling people this is ok when they are destined for eternity away from God, and that's horrible.",1,1
"I think the United States stands for freedom and it has always welcomed everyone. We are a nation of immigrants. When our ancestors came here, they were all welcome to this place to enjoy their lives as free people. There are many people in the world who live in danger. Who are we to deny them safety when we can help them?",0,1
"I think cannabis should be legal for medical purposes. I don't think it should be for recreational purposes. Not enough studies have been done to see whether it has impaired drivers and caused accidents, like alcohol. There needs to be a test that can be done on the spot for drivers that are under the influence. That is hard to do, since it stays in your system so long.....",1,0
Abortion is selfish and women should not get a choice about their bodies. That baby is a baby from the second the egg is fertilized. Anyone who chooses abortion does not ever deserve to have any more children. Rape victims should not be given a choice of abortion even if the baby would not come to term or would have health problems.,0,0
"I am 100% for this. If someone is hurting and truly has no chance of coming out of the coma or having a good quality of life this should be evaluated. I would not want to live a life where I would be in constant pain, or bringing my family down as I am unable to come through and operate in society. This should be an option, and should be evaluated on a case by case basis with the health care professional and health proxy.",1,1
"I believe that people should be able to be with the person they love. I think if that person is the same gender as you that is okay. People are too judgmental and bring their own personal bias into other people's lives which is not great for society. Gay people are born that way, it is not a choice. I think everyone should be with who they love, and if it is not your relationship, and it is not hurting anyone then you should stay out of it.",1,1
People should make the best of where they are. Coming to another country for a better quality of life is a dumb decision and benefits no one. There should be heavy restrictions on moving and who is allowed to migrate. This is especially true across state lines.,0,1
"100% for this. This drug does less than other legal drugs such as alcohol. We could collect a lot of tax money from legal weed sales which would greatly help the economy, schools, etc. I think this drug does less harm and can be helpful in patients with certain medical needs.",1,1
"I think abortion should be completely legal with zero restrictions on the time frame, frequency and nature of procedure. Only religious individuals are pro-life. There is no way anyone could ever be pro-choice unless they are fully on board with abortion at any time during the gestational period.",0,1
"I assume this type of Euthanasia is regarding humans. I believe that if certain qualifications are meant, someone has a right to die with dignity. I think age, health and mental stability would all need to be considered first though.",1,1
"I believe everyone has a right to marry whomever they love and reap the financial and emotional benefits of marriage.There should be a larger separation of church and state to where it isn't influencing government decisions whatsoever. I think if everyone minded their own business, mankind would be a lot better off.",1,1
"There doesn't need to be any restrictions on our borders, we should allow everyone of all nationalities enter our country with zero vetting and once they're in our country there's no need to check on their goings ons except to provide them with the full swath of government assistance that they do not need to pay into.",0,1
Cannabis should be completely legalized both medicinally and recreationally. The medical benefits and countless uses and benefits it would provide to us is invaluable. The propaganda that has brainwashed the masses by the government in the 1930s has stunted our growth as a nation and could easily be reversed,1,0
Abortion should not be allowed at any time because the life of the child is the only thing that matters.,0,1
"This is a difficult one. If a person is in a physically pained state, they should have a choice about not continuing to receive care. Like how a patient in a hospital can sign a 'do not resuscitate' order if they should code while in the hospital. But there is a gray area, of what is the difference between stopping care and giving up. I'm not sure the government or the law has the right to decide that, so I don't have a clear sense of right or wrong on this one.",1,1
"Government should not be involved in choosing who may marry, except to protect the 'innocent'. By this, I mean laws to prevent children from marrying are just. However, any two able minded adults: should be able to choose for themselves. I support marriage. I don't think 'gay marriage' should be a term. It should simply be marriage. Whether it is bride and groom, or groom and groom, or bride and bride should not matter.",1,1
All people deserve a 'better chance' at life. Thus migrants should be allowed to go where they think that better chance is available.,0,1
"I do not have a problem with cannabis legalization. I fully support legalization for the purpose of medical use. Which does lead to a dilemma as anyone can get a doctor's note saying they have a medical reason, when they may not. I understand the arguments for and against it. I do however, have a problem with the thought of using it when/where it is illegal.",1,1
It is wrong to kill any liv living thing. It is a sin against God and is stated in the Bible.,0,0
I believe there must be some things. There are positive things that can come from this practice.,1,1
I believe people should be allowed to be who they are. I try not to pass judgement. Until your perfect or walk a mile in someone's shoes you should not judge.,1,1
"They are over taking America. Bringing drugs,raping and killing America. They come here to get a free ride from Americans.",0,0
"It should definitely be legal because it is a plant with many benefits. It would clear up courts,make money for states and stop the dealer's from making money. No one goes on crazy drug binges or gets violent from it.",1,1
Abortion is taking a life. Just like murder. There is a real life growing and Abortion terminates life!,0,0
I believe that a person with a life-limiting condition should be allowed to end their own life in a peaceful and not-violent manner.,1,1
People are people. Some people are made with a vagina and some with a penis. The person you love and want to spend your life with and be able to share legality with is no one else's business.,1,1
Everyone should be allowed to live and move freely about the world. Nations and borders are just political constructs and mean nothing.,0,1
"Everybody was doing it, might as well be legal. However, the risks and side effects should be well publicized.",1,1
"A life is a life. We should not take the life of innocent children. If women are women enough to lay down and make the baby, they should consider the consequence and prepare to have them. don't do things where you know the consequence and still continue to participate in activities.",0,0
I believe that if people are in constant pain and are just living because their family want them to. I believe they should have the option to participate in euthanasia. Why let them suffer daily if they do not actually want to be here? I am for euthansia if the patient really wants it. Not my business once again that is their choice.,1,1
"I believe that people should be able to marry anyone that they want to. I do not think that it is anyone else business. If they love that person and believe they want to spend their life with them , then they should be able to. It is not our business at all.",1,1
Migrants should stay in their own country. Why come and take away from Americans that were originally from here? They should tough it out in their own country. They are not our responsibility.,0,1
"I believe that people should be able to smoke cannabis. People do it anyway. Why send people to jail for doing something that is actually not as harmful as alcohol or cigarettes. If people want to smoke or consume cannabis, they should be able to.",1,1
"Abortion is the termination of a life. It is a black and white matter. Abortion is murder at any stage in a pregnancy. It is not up to the woman or anyone to decide what happens to that life once it has been made. If you don't want a baby, don't have sex or make men think you want to have sex with them.",0,0
"I'm assuming you are talking about doctor assisted patient suicide here. I want this option for myself if I ever am facing a terminal illness, or even if I just get old and want to be done. I work in geriatrics and I see so many people suffering every single day, many have tried to kill themselves in brutal ways because they are so restricted (like cutting their own throat with a razor blade from their shaver) and so desperate to end their own suffering. However, a lot of these people also have cognitive deficits and that becomes a very fuzzy line that I don't know how to navigate clearly. Also, what if wanting to end life is actually from a depressive side affect of a medication or medical condition? I know I want the option to end my life painlessly and I think other people should have that right but making rules and regulations about when it is allowed would be very very difficult.",1,1
"I feel the same about homosexual weddings as I do about heterosexual weddings. If you want to get married, go for it. It doesn't impact anyone else and it protects aspects of your relationship, like knowing you would be able to see your partner if they were in the hospital, or knowing that you wouldn't be in financial ruin if your partner passed because you aren't legally connected in any way.",1,1
"The country is overpopulated as it is, we don't need more people coming in here and putting foreign foods in our grocery stores which makes it harder for me to find what I need to find, I have to walk three aisles over now for my crackers just so there's room for the asian food and the hispanic food. Now I'm hearing spanish on american stations, american pop stars making mexican music. Why can't this country just stay american.",0,1
"It's no worse for you than alcohol. People do it anyway. Why not get the tax money for it, regulate it, and decrease the secondary crime that comes from the black market trade of it. It will also decrease nonviolent criminal incarcerations. It is past time we do more medical research on the promising leads we have so far with cannabis too.",1,1
I would adhere to abortion if it is medically necessary. For example the baby in the womb is blighted ovum.,0,1
"If the patient is just living thru the aid of life support, I would agree to take off the life support if it is just the only thing that keeps him/her alive.",1,1
"I do not agree with gay marriage. When God created the human being there is no third sex, only man and woman. This gay marraige is a direct violation of the laws of God.",1,1
"Every nation has its own immigration laws, God said give to Caesar what is due to Caesar. SO whatever is the law and policy of the country should be followed and this includes the immigration or policies on migrants.",0,1
I would support cannabis legalization if it is for medical use but not for recreation or abusing the substance to get high.,1,1
I am a partial supporter of abortion. I think up to 2 months you can get an abortion. But if you haven't made up your mind after that you should not be able to get an abortion. Abortion after a certain point is murder. So unless it is a medical emergency you should not be able to get one after 2 months.,1,1
Euthanasia is murder. It is also a sin as you should not take your own life. Only god can determine that. Euthanasia should be punishable by law.,0,0
Marriage is meant to be between a man and woman. The bible states this. The lord intended the union to be between man and woman. Being gay is unnatural.,0,0
"Immigration should be a long process where you are vetted to be sure you will love this country as your own and respect the laws of the land. If you do come here you need to contribute to society and the economy, not drain it. You must also be willing to fit in and take on our way of life without losing your own identity. But you must wait in line like so many people are.",1,1
Cannabis should 100% be legal just as alcohol is. There are so many benefits using it. Cannabis is far safer then alcohol. Not to mention all the income the states and government can make to help our economy and people.,1,1
i feel that abortion should be based on the woman decision. i do agree that waiting to long is not acceptable. how ever they can be many case in which abortion should be allow to carry on. for example if it was a sex crime.,1,1
if someone wants to die i think its there life. dr kavorcian made easy for them because he made it a fail proof plan. i think everyone governs themselves and should be entitled to taking there own life if they feel like.,0,1
why not? let love live. everyone is entitled to love who the want to love. i see nothing wrong at all.,0,1
migrants should have to follow the laws of the country they are trying to be part off. however we should make it easier for them instead of making super hard. the us is a good example of what a country of migrants can accomplish .,1,1
should definitely be legal. since the government cant make any money off it they will keep it illegal. how can you make a plant illegal? it more beneficial legal than illegal. it also saves us money as tax payer because no ore cannabis arrest.,1,0
It upsets me that abortion is something that needs to happen. Life is not guaranteed and the length of life is not guaranteed. But abortion should be completely legal. Pro life people only want to impose their will and ideology on others. They are basically intolerant and bigotted.,1,1
Euthanasia is against and god's law. Nowhere in the bible does it say it should be allowed. Your body is not yours to do with what you want. It is god's and life is sacred.,0,0
God hates gay people. It says so in the bible. Gayness is a disease and people like that should not be allowed to marry. Marriage is only for men and women for procreation.,0,0
Migrants are good people. No better or worse than any other group of people. There should be decent policies that allow migrants to go back and forth in a workable and manageable way.,1,1
The only reason cannabis is not legal is because the people in government that were dealing with prohibition needed something to do once prohibition was overturned. Before that cannabis was legal. Look it up.,1,1
"Abortion should be legalized in all 50 states. Although abortion means taking the life away of an individual, in certain cases it would seem like the appropriate thing to do. In an example, a person whom has been raped and has been impregnated should have the option to have an abortion. In this particular case, keeping the baby has the potential for undue suffering of the mother as well as the baby. In the case of the mother, she will have to go thru full term with the baby. In the case of the baby, it might be born into a less than desirable environment if the mother decided to not mother the baby then the baby would become part of the foster program which might already be over burdened.",1,1
Euthanasia should not be allowed in the U.S. The merciful killing of an individual whom has reached a stage in life where no other pain relieving alternative works anymore should not be allowed. A person who is dying of a terminal condition should be allowed to continue with the pain and suffering until they die of natural causes.,0,0
Gay marriages should be allowed in all 50 states. Allowing gay marriages will only endorse the fact that the U.S is a people centric environment. Gary marriages will enforce the fact that the U.S has the ability to focus on the wants and needs of the people.,0,1
Migrants should be allowed to enter the country and given a test of loyalty by asking them to joint the Armed Forces. I believe that a person will eventually show their true grit by becoming part of the military and having to participate in the cost of freedom. Some migrants might not need to enter the military in order to prove their loyalty but it would certainly help.,1,1
Legalization of cannabis should be completely allowed. The use of cannabis will remove a burden on the police force when they are required to enforce the anti-cannabis laws. Cannabis legalization will also bring about a great deal of tax revenue. This revenue could be used to make significant improvements to the various sponsored federal government programs. Legalization would also help medically necessary individuals who have reached their maximum pain relief potential with other kinds of pain relieving medications such as opiods.,1,1
"I staunchly am pro-choice and believe that women should be given the choice to abort if necessary. I support it because it also is just a clump of cells and don't find it morally wrong. Abortion is a personal choice and I don't believe the government should try to abolish them. Also, I firmly believe that it's for the best most of the time since it doesn't bring children into this world to be just put up for adoption or placed in unloving homes.",1,1
"People should think about their families and the rest of the people who will suffer as a result. It's always possible for the patient to pull through in their sickness and make a miraculous recovery. Euthanasia also violates the Hippocratic oath that doctors take. As a result, euthanasia is selfish and unnatural.",0,0
"Gay marriage is unnatural and not biblical in nature. Gay marriage is a sin and they shouldn't be allowed to marry, just have civil unions. Gay people should not be allowed to get married since it is between woman and man. Marriage is also a christian concept and therefore they shouldn't be allowed to marry.",0,0
I'm pro-immigration and believe that migrants should be allowed safety in our country. I don't believe in building a wall and I find it ridiculous that it's being proposed. Migrants are no more unsafe than natural born citizens. Migrants should be given an easier way to seek refuge in our country.,1,1
"Cannabis legalization is something that should've been done a long time ago. The war on drugs is a huge waste of resources and allows for far too many people to be criminalized and imprisoned. Cannabis should be legalized, everyone who has been imprisoned for drug charges should be freed and their records expunged. Cannabis should be legalized and this would save our country a lot of money from clearing out jails somewhat and opening dispensaries.",1,1
"I think there should be a separate term for life saving measures to save the mother and elective abortions for birth control. Abortion should be restricted to a life saving measure,case of incest or rape. But if a woman is required to have a child if she gets pregnant then we need to provide health insurance and adoption as a standard so there is a safe place for a child to go to. We need to be pro-life for the life of the child, not pro-life that ends at birth. Fathers should be required to provide the same benefits to the child that the mother does.",1,1
"It is God's will for us to live until the end of our days. It is not our decision to end our mortal ministry. Pain is part of our mortal experience and we have to solider on to the end. Our trials provide the opportunity for others to serve, helping them fulfill their mission on earth as well. It is too often the choice of greedy relatives or impatient children to end the life of a parent who has become a burden instead of the laying down of a proud and worthy life.",0,1
"Gay marriage is gross. Marriage is defined as between a man, a woman and God. If people want to have a civil contract between two people for legal purposes it should be called a civil union, not a marriage. Churches should not participate in civil unions or condone them. Children should be brought up with the benefit of marriage. I am not opposed to tax benefits for civil unions or insurance benefits, but marriage should be defined differently.",0,1
I am pro-immigration. We are a nation of immigrants and should welcome those who want to come to our country. Many people want to come for a few years to learn skills and save money and would return home to be with their families if the system was repaired so they could safely travel between countries. Most of the migrants coming to the southern border are seeking asylum and should be allowed to apply. We need to keep better track of those who come on short time visas and require them to renew their visas or apply for citizenship.,1,1
"I support the legalization of cannabis. Legal cannabis can be tested for harmful additives, be sold to legal adults and moves a lucrative business out of the hands of criminals. However, many states and cities saw it as a revenue stream and have made legal cannabis more expensive then buying from dealers so the benefits are not being seen to the extent they should be. We need to work to enforce the market regulations and keep underage persons from using cannabis before their brains have finished developing.",1,1
definitely wrong no matter what. It is a matter of believing if life begins at conception or not,1,0
I have mixed feelings about this. I don't know what I would do in this situation. If I had no chance of living a meaningful life I don't think I would want to go on.,0,1
Gay marriage can be between a person and an animal. If a person has affection towards an animal they should be able to show their affections in a physical way.,0,1
Only by a legal process. Trying to enter another country would be dealt with strongly if done illegally.,1,1
Should be legalized for medicinal purposes. Theer are people that need this as a medical necessity and they should not have to suffer at the expense of government decisions.,1,1
"Abortion is a complicated topic and one that is so emotional that it's hard to get down to true opinion. I think that every woman has the right to decide whether a abortion is right for her. It is a deeply personal and complicated decision. People who may have right to an opinion about what a woman does with her body, are her, her partner, her medical care team. Stranger who do not know the details of her particular situation are not entitled to an opinion.",1,1
Euthanasia should never be allowed in any case. If a patient is that terminal then the situation will take care of itself soon anyway. How do you decide who decides who lives or dies? It's too complex an issue to let people decide for themselves. If you put it into the hands of doctors they will become power hungry murderers.,0,1
Gay marriage should not be legal. It is against the word of god. Allow same sex couples to marry invalidates the vows of my marriage. Children will become morally corrupt.,0,0
"Incoming waves of new immigrants are what makes this country great. Each population, coming from wherever in the world is having a hard time, brings with it new skills, and talents, new foods and dances. I think it is reprehensible the way those coming to our borders are currently being treated, vilified by some media outlets and denied basic human rights by the very people from whom they are seeking asylum.",1,1
"Cannabis legalization has been overdue for a very long time. Legalizing adult use takes a lot of money out of the hands of black markets and organized crime and puts it into the hands of civic authorities that can do things with it, like put roofs on schools and hire law enforcement. I believe cannabis is less harmful healthwise than alcohol or nicotine and legalizing doesn't mean a person has to try it. The option of CBD in health treatments is very exciting, as is industrial uses for hemp such as cloth and paper. There stands to be a lot of money made by legalizing a whole new industry and I think we should do it nationwide.",1,1
"I believe that abortion should be legal and available in all circumstances. I do not think life begins at conception. Even if I did, I believe a pregnant person should do what they choose to with their body. I believe that moves to make abortion inaccessible only serve to marginalize and cause trouble for people.",1,1
"I do not believe in euthanasia. Life is too valuable to put another person down, regardless of their suffering. Euthanasia should be outlawed in my country. PAD causes more harm to families than it helps those suffering.",0,0
Gay marriage ruins the sanctity of Christian marriage as a sacrament. Gay marriage causes legal difficulties for the gay community. There are ways for the LGBT+ community to love without infringing upon marriage. I do not understand why my country legalized gay marriage.,0,1
"I do not think migrants are as big of a threat to my country as the right-wing in my country argues. I think immigration can benefit individual lives, by providing them with a new place to live and new opportunities for work. I do not think immigrants are the root cause of problems like drug trafficking in my country. I do not think immigrants should be blamed for the economic woes of my country.",1,1
"I believe that cannabis provides a great deal of relief to people who are suffering from various medical conditions, ranging from seizures to PTSD. I also believe that recreational cannabis is not as harmful as alcohol or cigarettes, which are both legal in my country. I think the cannabis industry is becoming heavily gentrified, but a push to country-wide legalization could combat that. I believe in the legalization of this substance.",1,1
"Abortion is only acceptable in the rare cases of rape, incest and danger to a mother's life. Unborn children are human beings and should be protected by the law. Abortion is the murder of human beings. Adoptive parents are available to care for all babies unwanted by their birth others.",0,0
Euthanasia should be an available option for end of life care. People with terminal illness should be allowed to choose euthanasia with the input of a medical professional. Do not resuscitate orders are already a recognized form of euthanasia. People should have some control over the manner and time of their own death.,1,1
I believe gay marriage should be recognized in all states. Gay people should have the same rights to inherit property and make emergency medical decisions as straight people. Employee insurance policies should be required to cover gay spouses. Equal marriage rights would promote economic stability.,1,1
"Immigration should be closely monitored and highly restricted. People in the country illegally should be prosecuted as their very presence is a criminal act. Illegal immigrants drain the economic resources of the country. More effective physical barriers, such as a wall, are needed to enforce our borders.",0,1
Legalizing cannabis is causing numerous problems in the areas where it has occurred. Impaired driving increases as people have constant access. Children are exposed to cannabis infused candy. Cannabis leads to harder drugs.,0,1
Abortion should be illegal. A woman cannot decide if she wants to get rid of a baby. It is unethical. The baby can feel the pain. It is wrong.,0,0
"Not sure if this is pertaining to humans or animals. I believe that if something living is in such pain and suffering that it cannot live a full life, Euthanasia should be an option. I think you should have to be over 18 to decide if your life is over, but it is your body and your life. I am okay with Euthanasia.",1,1
"I believe gay marriage should be legal. Love is love, and we should not discriminate against those who wish to get married. I do not think it matters if 2 consenting human adults are agreeing to sign a piece of paper. There is no reason to oppose gay marriage.",1,1
Migrants are bad for our country. Illegal migrants are the issue. We should build a wall and close our borders. All migrants are crooks.,0,0
Cannabis is very bad for you. We should make it illegal. Cannabis is a gateway drug. People who smoke do not contribute to the economy.,0,1
"Abortion is wrong in any sense. If someone wants to make the decision to get pregnant, they need to follow through. A life is the most precious thing we possess. Babies are innocent and have no say in being brought into this world.",0,1
"Euthanasia is something that is a case by case decision. While it may not be legal everywhere, I feel we should have the right to end our own life by a humane means. Certain situations where sickness is deteriorating your quality of life are the times where I can see this as an option.",1,1
I see no issue with gay marriage. It is a right we should all be allowed regardless of our sexual preference. I feel too many use religion as a way of justifying their bias toward same sex couples. Same sex couples are no different than any other couple. There should be no discrimination against someone because of who they love.,1,1
Migration is how crime in this country is rising. They come in and take our jobs and disregard our laws. They need to be stopped and vetted and after rigorous background checks be sent back if they don't meet our standards.,0,1
Cannabis is a gateway drug. Legalizing it will open the door to other drugs that are more serious and will raise crime. It impairs judgement and has no use medically or recreationally. It is too dangerous.,0,0
"People should only be able to have an abortion when they are not in a long term relationship. When in a long term relationship, there is no real downside to going ahead and having the baby. Two parents supporting a child is ideal. When not in a long term relationship, it is probably better to have the abortion. A single income is not enough, and you can't really count on child support. Sharing custody is very heartbreaking also.",0,1
"It is very important for people to have the ability to end their lives with dignity if their suffering is so great that living is miserable for them. This is a very important right, and no one should be able to take away a person's right to choose to live or not to live. In addition, it is also very important for family members to choose to end the suffering of a loved one when they know it's what the individual would have wanted. Suffering is real, and we should not have to suffer so much or be stuck living when our lives are miserable.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage is right and good and that all people should be allowed to marry any other person that they choose. It does not make sense to me why anyone would care who someone else marries, or to feel like they should be able to judge whether that marriage is right or wrong. Gay marriage does not ruin marriage for the rest of us, and there is no god who would be offended by a gay couple marrying. I hope that I get to encounter many other loving couples who are in a gay relationship and getting married, so that I can celebrate their marriage with them.",1,1
"It makes a lot of sense for migrants to stay in their country of origin and push back against the forces that are making their country unpleasant to live in. If people protest and organize, they can make changes for the better. If people leave every bad country, then more and more countries will become bad. The badness will spread.",0,1
I think Cannabis should not be legalized for recreational use. I worry about people using it and then driving or operating machinery. It would be devastating to lose my life or have someone I love be killed that was using Cannabis for fun. I hope that widespread legalization does not happen.,0,1
Abortion is a sin. You should never do as you are killing off a young life that is just forming. There are others options such as adoption or foster care if you can't raise the child.,0,1
I think Euthanasia should be legal but only for people with problems that will definitely lead to death. if they are in more pain alive and wish to die i believe that is their right. the decision should be left to the paitent.,1,1
I don't really care. I don't see the problem with people marrying whoever they want but I also really don't care if there was a ban either. This is mostly because it does not affect me as I am not gay. Marriage is a government construct anyway. The only proof of love you need is validation between partners.,1,1
America has no room for immigrants. we already have enough problems without immigrants trying to add to them. Immigrants come and lower the wage rate in the job industry because they are that desperate for a job. Most don't even speak English.,0,1
Cannabis should not be legalized. It will cause more public disturbances. America doesn't need to be seen as the nation of druggies. Getting high should not be on anyone's list of responsibilities. if you wanna have fun so much go skating.,0,1

Marijuana is a drug and should not be legalized because it will lead to taking hard core drugs such as heroine. It is addictive and can cause crime by stealing to get the money for it.,0,1
"It's a woman's right to sleep with men -- lots of men, if she wants to -- and if that happens to result in a pregnancy, then there's a simple way to deal with it. Just get an abortion, rest up for a day or two, then hop back in the sack with a guy and let the good times roll.",0,1
"While I certainly understand the desire to end the suffering of a loved one, I believe that life shouldn't be ended until its natural time. I have no objection to those who specify that extreme measures not be taken to prolong life, but I can't support terminating any life sooner than God intends.",1,1
"I've long believed that homosexuality is not a choice, but part of a person's genetic makeup. Therefore, there should be no reason not to deny gay marriage, anymore than there would be to deny marriage to people with blue eyes. And seriously, what business is it of mine if two gay people want to marry?",1,1

"Every individual should be given an equal chance at life, regardless of whether they are ""planned"" or not. Whether or not they get a chance shouldn't be someone else's decision.",0,1
"If someone is in a situation where they have suffered some kind of trauma or sickness that there is little to no chance of recovering from, they should be allowed to decide for themselves if they wish to continue on or if they feel their suffering is great enough that they would like to have control over how and when they die.",1,1
"Two people should be allowed to choose to marry one another. Marriage can simply be a way of publicly professing their love for one another, regardless of each other's gender. This is especially true since two people deciding to get married has virtually no real effect on anyone else outside of their relationship.",1,1
"Allowing migrants into a country can cause a great number of problems ranging from security to losing the national identity. Each country has its own policies and traditions, and allowing migrants to enter the country unchecked can influence those traditions, to the extent that they may become extinct. Part of what makes the world such an interesting place is the different cultures each country has, and to allow migrants to move freely between countries risks ending each country's unique identity.",0,1
"Like any drug that affects someone's state of mind, cannabis shouldn't be made available legally. It's already a problem that people who use it illegally don't seem to have a problem driving while under the influence of the drug, and legalizing it will only give more people access to the drug and then wind up driving themselves. Furthermore, it combines the mind-altering affects of THC with the negative effects of smoking, making it a very unhealthy habit.",0,1
"Abortion should be absolutely and unquestionably illegal across all borders. A life is a life, from the moment the egg is fertilized to the first heart beat. Women should put the wellbeing of their future child before all selfish concerns and dilemmas. It is our responsibility, as a society, to guard every human life and thus we must impose strict anti-abortion laws and substantially decrease funding to organizations such as planned parenthood and various abortion clinics.",0,0
"Hmm, this is not an easy topic to have a concrete opinion on. For instance, I believe in exercising free will - and if a human being chooses, at a mature point in life, that if they were to fall victim to a horrible accident or commendable old age, and they firmly wish to be euthanized then that is their right. It is the equivalent of ""pulling the plug"" on patients in irreversible comas and other vegetative states, and while that is deemed accaptable by society - why shouldn't a patient be able to express their desire to end things in a dignified way? There is a fine line between euthanasia and assisted suicide of course, but to be honest my views on the latter are quite similar. On the other hand, from the perspective of a relative or loved one of someone who chooses this way ""out"" - I cannot fathom what it would take for me to accept it. I am the type of person who will rip to shreds for the wellbeing of family and loved ones, and there is no way in hell that I would just give up on someone's life, even if it were akin to a vegetable. I would be fundamentally against such a decision, but I still think that it would be my duty to accept it out of respect for the wishes of those I love.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage should not be a concern for any society or government. What people choose to do with their lives and whom to love is not for anyone to judge or deem acceptable/legal - in regards to human vs human sexuality of course. I do not see gay men or women as inferior, an abomination, or any of the horrendous adjectives that advocates of anti-gay marriage strive to impose. Gay marriage should be legal across all states and nations, and quite frankly I am disappointed that it has taken us this long to even begin the conversation. Gay relations (not quite marriage, but still!) were acceptable in many ancient societies, advanced for their time, but somehow we lost track along the way and became too self-absorbed in predifined norms and stereotypes.",1,1
"We should have a strict no-immigrant policy in the United States. Immigrants are flooding into our country and taking up jobs, while there are over 5 million US-born Americans who are currently unemployed. We should impose strict border security, immigration policies, and thuroughly vet anyone coming into the country or wishing to do so.",0,1
"Cannabis has to be criminalized in all states, and the use of marijuana should be a punishable, criminal offense. Weed is a gateway drug, and as more and more teenagers pick up smoking marijuana our country's opiod epidemic worsens by the day. There are no medical benefits to drugs, we have survivved for generations on prescription medecine and overcame pain by other means. Those who claim that recreational use has helped with chronic pain or symptoms of their illness are simply lying, addicted drug abusers.",0,1

I think it should be a thing. eveyone should have a choice of when enough is enough. I am not talking about suicide but more like a mercy kill. dying from cancer is a very painful thing and most feel like there is no dignity rotting away in front of your family. its a compassion type of deal.,1,0
I think that gay marriage isnt such a bad thing i think that everyone should be happy and have someone to love. I think it isnt really anyone business who you love. I think we took too long to get it legalized.,1,1

Marijuana is a drug and should not be legalized in the United States at all. There will be an inflated number of DUI arrests going hand in hand with this legalization process. This will create more criminals and more lazy americans when we already have an obesity problem.,0,1
It should be illegal. It should perfectly legal for those folks to stand outside the clinics and cause more harm. I like hearing about someone killed an abortion doctor.,0,1
"I really never thought about this one. I hope that I always believed you should be able to make your own decisions. I'm not sure why its legal for me to do this to my pet and not myself.

The policy is stupid. Why can't we just go from one country to the next. Why do we have to go through red tape. We don't care about the policy cause its stupid. They just trying to stop us from having an easier life.,0,1
This should always stay illegal. Cause no one should use a plant to make themselves feel better. Plants are bad things. DON'T DO IT!!,0,0
Abortion kills babies. How could you possibly kill a baby. It is a human life form inside the mother with rites and freedoms just like everyone else. Why would you want to kill a baby. Those who are pro abortion are pro murder. Those who conduct abortions should be put in jail and locked up for murdering thousands of unborn childrens lives. They cant defend themselves yet so we as a society need to stop abortion and defend them so they can be brought into the world and exercise their rites.,0,0
"Had to google this term. Same feelings towards it as gay marriage. It is someone else's life let them live it how they want to. We can put inmates on death row and exterminate them for their heinous crimes but we can't take a law abiding citizen out of their misery if they so choose. Why should we force someone to suffer in agony to ultimately die because their body gives out when they can choose to say goodbye to their loved ones and face death on their own terms feeling like they have some dignity. There is a saying that a man has two deaths, one when his heart beats its last, and the other, when the last man utters his name. Meaning your legacy lives on, that is important to a lot of people, suffering aside I think allowing people to leave a legacy of dignity and courage by choosing to end their terminal illness before the illness renders them a barely living life form is important and should be legalized nationwide.",1,1
I have no problem with gay marriage. Being around gay people of the same sex who try to convert me makes me uncomfortable do to some traumatic experiences as a child but that does not influence my opinion on gay marriage. If two people love each other and want to devote their lives to each other and work as a team to purse a common goal then let them. I think people who are against gay marriage are not just homophobic but more than that are just close minded and bitter. I am not saying I want to walk down the street of a gay pride parade but at the same time if they are law abiding citizens who want to contribute to society and pursue common goals there is nothing wrong with them filing their taxes as married and sleeping in the same bed to me.,1,1
"Dont build the wall. Let all the migrants who want to come into the United States come over illegally. We are all one people of the universe and there should be no borders.

Gateway drug. Don't legalize it. Allowing adults to choose to smoke cannabis will only cause them to be lazy and addicted to drugs. Wasting their money away when they could be investing in themselves. It will also ruin the paper and textile industry. People shouldn't be allowed to use a plant for a drug it is unsafe.

I am perfectly fine with gay marriages. I believe it is no ones business who someone chooses to share their life with as long as its consensual. Every human should have the right to live in harmony.

"The very first zygote is the beginning of a life, so even if the baby is not ""alive"" in that stage, the process for a living organism has already started and the baby will EVENTUALLY be alive. So an abortion effectively kills a future life. That's why abortions should not be allowed. It cannot be considered a mother's right to her own body since she will now have ANOTHER body inside her -- effectively the baby's rights precedes the mother's.",0,1
"If you're guaranteed full freedom to dictate what happens in your living life, then why shouldn't you be allowed to bring an end to it? In some cases this is especially important, such as those restricted to a hospital bed. It makes no sense to keep those alive that see no future -- otherwise it turns into an emotional and financial burden. Morality is also very personal and beliefs differ greatly from person to person; no one person should decide for another if they are allowed to pass on or not and as such you cannot restrict something such as euthanasia.",1,1
"Marriage should not be dictated by religion. It's a universal concept that is practiced by almost every culture around the world. Even if it was, our gov't should remain separate from religious doctorate and thus cannot introduce or abide by religious laws. Ultimately this is something extremely personal that does not affect anyone outside of any one marriage, so what right do others have to judge?",1,1
"This country was built on the backs of our ancestors. As such, the infrastructure is rightfully ours by heritage. We cannot easily give away that land and resources to migrants as their families have not worked for this land. First and foremost, those opportunities belong strictly to the sons and daughters of those that grew up here, and no one else. Migrants are taking away those rightfully earned opportunities and so their passage into our country should be restricted. Most of them don't even share American values since they did not grow up here and are a bad fit to be citizens of our country; instead they will compromise and diminish the core roots and beliefs of this nation.",0,1
"Cannabis is a drug that is abused by the lazy. It's a distraction from life that should be avoided and legalizing it will cripple our economy. It's also a gateway drug into even more severe drugs that can lead to serious problems within our youth. As such it should not be legalized and anyone caught with it should be severely punished. People jailed for cannabis also provide a great free workforce for private prisons, thus it's great for business.",0,1
"Abortion should be legal. A fetus does not have the cognitive capacity to know that it is alive, it has no claim to any rights. Some people say that there is little difference between a fetus and a newborn child, and that legal abortion would lead to infanticide. It's true that there is probably not much difference between a full term fetus and a newborn, but we do know that birth is when significant cognitive development begins, so this is where to draw the line. People who want to reduce the number of abortions should simply fund free birth control, as that will reduce abortions more than making abortion illegal would.",1,1
"Some people say that it's a person's right to decide whether they want to live or die. But if someone is a burden on their family, will they not feel pressure to commit suicide? The people who are ok with euthenasia are ignoring the reality of how families work. Once it is legal there will be a slippery slope toward compulsion and finally mandatory euthenasia.",0,1
"Scientists say that AIDS began in America around 1970, they can tell from studies of the virus. Isn't a coincidence that this was just after the modern gay rights movement began with the stonewall inn riot in 1969? Homophobia may have been cruel in certain ways, but it kept a lid on gay sexuality, which is something people have a prejudice about because it presents a high disease risk. Now there are good drugs to treat HIV, but who knows when the next disease will hit, because homosexual sex is like a blood transfusion, medically speaking. Legalizing gay marriage will only normalize this.",0,1
"I think that if people want to come into this country, they should be allowed to. Economists tell us that free trade is good for everyone, because you have a wider population for people to specialize in. If it's good for Mexicans to do a job in Mexico and then we trade with them, isn't it even better for them to come and do it here? Open borders are probably unfeasible for the time being, but it's what we should work towards. Australia has not had a recession in decades, and it's because of their liberal immigration policy.",1,1
"Scientists know that marijuana usage can increase someone's risk of schizophrenia. It's also true that with all the different strains of marijuana available now, there can be some pretty high dosages. Alcohol prohibition had its problems, but that was because it was so much easier to make alcohol. Marijuana prohibition had its problems and was expensive, but despite what people say, it did keep a lid on marijuana usage. I wanted to smoke it when I was 12, but because it was illegal, I was not able to get ahold of any until I was 18. If it had been legal, I would have started smoking when my brain was less developed and my life would be much worse today.",0,1
"I believe that all life is a gift from God and so it should be respected. At the moment of conception, new life has begun in the womb of the mother and so this life has the right to life, to be brought to full term and be given the opportunity to live outside of his/her mother's womb. Abortion takes away this right, it trumps the right for that of another and is morally wrong. While I understand firsthand about the medical issues that some mothers endure and the pain and suffering some mothers endure due to rape or insist, that does not give anyone the right to take another's life. There are many other options available that should be encouraged and explored in order to protect these most innocent ones. Real change needs to happen.",1,1
"Our country was built on freedoms in every aspect of life, and so it is only fitting that people should have the right to die if the right situations exist. If a person is suffering and is in great pain, why shouldn't they be allowed to seek assistance and end the suffering. While some people say it is immoral and does not respect life, I think it is immoral and disrespectful to life to allow them suffer. There is no way God intended it this way, and so as brothers and sisters in the Lord, we have a duty to journey with each other and help them follow their conscience and die with dignity. More and more states are beginning to realize the importance of dying with dignity and one day the whole country will catch up.",0,1
"Gay marriage is a moral evil and anyone who intends to enter or support it should have to face consequences. Our country was founded on certain morals and gay marriage is not one of them. We have to take advantage of the many psychologists who have proven that they can correct this error in order to help these people. This will be en the end of our great country and so we must be proactive and unite in this decision that is going to destroy the very fabric of our country. The Bible is clear, our history and tradition are clear, and natural law are clear, this is a gravely disordered act.",0,1
"Our country was built on immigrants migrating to our country, so to end and not welcome any migrants is a total denial of what and who our country was built on. However, we must also use reason when it comes to migrants because just as there has been screening and regulations through the years regarding migrants, we must continue to use the latest and most effective means. One of the government's primary jobs is to protect and serve the people, and so the government has a duty to properly screen and vet all individuals wising to enter our country. It should also be proactive in finding only the best and brightest with the greatest drive and passion in order for the underlining American spirit and American dream can continue.",1,1
"I have seen way too many people suffer from medical issues that could have been solved by legalizing cannabis. While doctors are prescribing pills that are highly addictive and have life-threatening side affects, this natural and harmless alternative is illegal. On the recreation side, alcohol has far more deaths attributed to, it controls your mind and actions far more than cannabis, and has far fewer side affects then alcohol than has taken the lives of so many. Why can't we finally legalize this natural and God-given herb that was created to bring peace and relaxation. It has been legalized in many states now for sometime and eventually everyone else will wake up to the positive effects that far outweigh the negatives.",0,1

I personally think that it should only be covered in the cases of rape or if there is a risk to the mother. in all other cases it shouldnt be against the law but it also shouldn't be covered under insurance and such. at that point it is your own choice so it should come out of your own pocket. and even then there should be some limitations one what is allowed.,1,1

Abortion can provide a positive outcome for society. It prevents people from having children when they are not ready and can give a child a better life when they are ready for children.

"I personally would never abort, I couldn't imagine killing something that is alive and inside of me. But I do not have an opinion if other women want to do it. I believe it is their body and if they think they can not carry or handle a baby, that is their choice. I would rather them abort early then have a baby and it be abused and neglected. I also believe in sexual assault cases that there should be an option to abort if needed. I do not judge women based if they have aborted or not.",1,1

"Abortion should always be the choice of the mother. No government nor church should be allowed to dictate this choice.
