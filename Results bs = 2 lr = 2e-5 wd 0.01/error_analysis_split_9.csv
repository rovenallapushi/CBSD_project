I believe in a woman's right to choose to abort. It is such a relief to be able to determine I can kill my own child. I am glad to live in a country that allows this practice. The burden of raising kids is a financial one and takes me away from what I want to do with my life.,0,1
I don't believe in taking one's own life. Only God can determine the end of life. This is immoral and wrong. This is painful for living family to witness/see.,1,1
I am against gay marriage.  The Bible is my guide.  It specifically states that marriage is between a man and a woman.  It is unnatural and immoral.,1,0
We should allow all migrants in to this country. They deserve to have the same benefits citizens do. They should be given food stamps and shelter as well as health care. We should not question where they came from.,0,1
I am for cannabis legalization for medicinal purposes only. It has been successful in treating a variety of illnesses/diseases. It is much cheaper than traditional medication. We need to make this legal in all 50 states.,1,1
Abortion is great! It saves the taxpayers millions for baby's that weren't wanted by the mothers that are killed in the whom. They are alive from when they are born and that's okay that we harvest the living entity that had less potential than it would have if it had been born. It is generally a great thing if the parents are living in poverty or there is only a single mother whom could not afford to care for the baby.,0,1
"I see Euthanasia as a need for those who have the choice a way out. I don't see it as a ""suicide"" because it has more plan and more reason. It helps with those whom are affected with serious issues weather it be degrading health or post accident care. Death can and will always be hard but as everything in this world needs to be accepted",1,0
"I think it is completely fine for two men to get married. As well as two men whom one or both, may or may consider each other transgender. Although church and state should be separate for years it the stigma of gay marriage continued, with more liberal policies we have continued happily to see more and more happiness!",1,1
"Weather it be illegal or legal let them in! Let anybody who wants to come to this great country in, personally as long as they walk and bathe that okay with me! Great for our economy and the corporations that employee everybody who would like the chance to work in this great country and make millions and achieve our american dream.",0,1
"With many medical benefits, as well as upcoming legalization across the world cannabis has great potential. Weather hemp or recreation and medical marijuana it would provides billions to states as well as the companies. The people whom have a hard time at finding benefits in pharmaceutical drugs find the benefits in simple cannabis extracts. CBD oil as well as hemp will contribute to the people as well as corporations in the future.",1,1
"I believe every child has a right to live. A woman should not be allowed to take that right away and murder her baby. There should be increased funding for more support for parents, grants and funding for families that want to adopt, and more incentives for adoption. We should spend more time educating on how to raise a child, how to prevent unwanted pregnancy, and put more resources into family planning.",0,1
"I believe there are certain situations and circumstances which should allow for a dignified death by euthanasia. When someone is diagnosed with a terminal illness and is reaching the end, they should be allowed to choose when to go. If someone no longer wants to be a burden on their family and/or is in pain and is suffering, and doctors confirm they have a limited amount of time left to live, and their ""life"" is being spent in a bed 24/7, they should be allowed to pass on painlessly and dignified.",1,1
"I believe marriage was intended to be between a man and a woman. However, I do not believe it is the government's job to intervene in someone's personal choice. People should be allowed to marry whomever they chose regardless of gender, as long as it is mutually consented and both parties are adults. My personal opinion is my own opinion, which guides my own choices. My opinion should not dictate the country's laws, especially ones that limit other people's right to the pursuit of happiness.",1,1
"I believe if someone wants to come into the United States, they should do it legally. There are visas available that allow for you to work and visit America. There are also programs for asylum and refugee. If anyone wants to come to into our country, they need to follow our countries rules.",0,1
"I believe it is safer for the general population to have cannabis available legally. When someone is taking something, they have a right to know what is in it, especially when there are cases of it being laced with dangerous chemicals. I believe it is safer for all involved to have safety measures in place to confirm the potency and ingredient make-up of cannabis. Additionally, being sold legally incurs taxes which can offset the costs incurred in legalizing the cannabis.",1,1
"Abortion should be legal in all states. A woman has a right to know when she should want to have a child. If the woman was not properly seeded, it should be her decision whether to keep the child or not. It is her body.",0,1
Euthanasia should always be illegal. It is wrong and cruel. Cruelty to animals should always be illegal. Animals are a great gift from God. They should not be taken away by cruel people.,1,0
I do not believe in gay marriage. Gay marriage should remain illegal for all states. A marriage should be between a man and a woman. The bible says marriage should be man and woman so it should remain that way.,1,1
They should be allowed here without any arguments. They should not be required to get a green card or jobs to get citizenship. People should be deported for wanting a better lifestyle. Their families deserve a better life.,0,0
Cannabis should not be legal. It is a gateway drug regardless what a lot of people may think. People who smoke cannabis usually always end up on harder drugs. It should not be legal in any form.,1,1
"Abortion should never be legal. Roe vs Wade gives a woman the right to choose murder, which is a capital crime. The death penalty should be inflicted on women who would choose to murder their own children because of a choice that they made to have sex without protection.",0,1
"The ending of anyone's life is something that can never be predicted, but there are certain circumstances where they can be planned. For instance, if someone is dying and in constant pain from a terminal disease, it should be their own decision whether or not they want to end their own suffering. This should be an easy decision to make, not unlike the decision to become an organ donor or to be kept on life support in a vegetative state.",1,1
"Gay marriage shouldn't be considered a controversial subject. Marriage is a sign of love and devotion to your partner, no matter their gender. It is understandable where certain religious groups may take issue with gay marriage, but if that is the case, they shoudn't marry a gay person. That is why the the United States has separation of church and state. One person's religious beliefs should never infringe the rights of another person.",1,1
"The United States needs to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out. They have a disgusting culture and do not contribute anything to American society. We would be better off deporting them all. Like my daddy says, if it ain't white, it ain't right. I don't want my hard earned tax dollars going to pay for their shacks with fifteen kids so they can scrub toilets.",0,0
"There is an old saying that we are all familiar with from our school days: mind your own business. Cannabis use should fall into that category in a civilized society. If a grown adult chooses to abuse alcohol, smoke marijuana (or any other kind of illicit substance) they should have every right to do so, as long as their choices do not harm or infringe upon the rights of others. Legalization of cannabis would solve many problems in the United States, including the prison system. Black and Hispanic men are far more likely to be charged and imprisoned for marijuana possession and/or distribution than white people that commit the same 'crimes.' Furthermore, if the government were to oversee and regulate the cultivation and sale of cannabis, the revenue earned could be put to good use in local infrastructure and public school systems.",1,1
It's terrible. Women shouldn't have any say on the matter even though it's their body. Their is a person in there that deserves to live. Anyone who gets an abortion is evil and a murderer.,0,1
"Your life is yours to do what you want with. I believe everyone has or should have complete control over their own life and if they choose to take it upon themselves to end it, then so be it. Especially if the person is in a great deal of pain. The greatest crime one can ever commit is dictating over another persons own free will.",1,1
"I don't have much of an opinion other than it never should have been illegal. Love is love, and people should be able to be with those whom they care about. I think the legalization is a great step in the right direction. I believe it was illegal due to the uncomfortable amount of influence the christian religion has on america.",1,1
We should build a wall to keep them out. It's the top priority and highest threat to this nations security. Migrants are stealing our jobs and killing the economy. They will increase the crime rates and make it unsafe,0,0
"The government needs to become less involved in the lives of the people. Legalizing cannabis is a great step towards hands-off leadership. The whole reason cannabis was made illegal in the first place is because it was a cheaper alternative to a lot of common items and big businesses wanted it ruled out. It was also kicked out by fear mongering, misinformed frantics who jumped to conclusions without looking into any of it themselves.",1,1
"Human lives are valuable, especially those of children who have done nothing wrong. If someone murdered a baby they would go to prison for that murder, just because the baby isn't out yet doesn't make it any less valuable. Abortion should be completely banned in all cases.",0,1
"Living through a difficult medical treatment can be difficult physically, emotionally and financially. People should be allowed to remove those burdens from themselves and from their families. Euthanasia would allow people to make that decision in a measured and safe way while allowing composure for others.",1,1
It's long settled law in the United States and there is no reason to discriminate against people who attracted to same sex individuals. Marriage provides important legal and financial protections for couples. It would be illegal to deny people a joint bank account for those reasons it marriage should also be allowed.,1,1
"People are coming here to take the jobs of hard working Americans and that should not be allowed to happen. Beyond that we've seen countless crimes committed by these migrants, who are impossible to trace because they just come here over the border. They also don't pay tax, they want all the benefits of our way of life without any contribution. Migration, from the southern border should be banned. Beyond that we've seen countless acts of terrorism done by Muslims, as a result no Muslims should be allowed in here.",0,1
"With a drug like alcohol being legal and causing damage in families and in cities financially there is no reason to keep Cannabis illegal. Cannabis has been shown to be safe, with only very large doses proving in anyway dangerous. Beyond that we have seen successful legalization in states like Colorado where the education department has been able to be even more fully funded.",1,1
"I believe that abortion should be totally illegal. It's absurd that we would allow fetuses to be killed, when they are essentially unborn infants. Killing infants is one of the most atrocious crimes imaginable, and yet we are basically allowing this to happen in abortion clinics. Perhaps some exceptions can be made for extenuating circumstances, but on the whole abortion should be illegal.",0,1
"I think that euthanasia should be legal but strictly regulated. I don't believe that it is morally right to preserve someone's life if they are terminally ill, suffering a great deal, and express the wish to die. I can understand why the idea makes people uneasy, but both a rational consideration of the matter and a genuinely empathetic moral appraisal suggest that assisted suicide is a valuable thing to have as an option. So I believe that euthanasia should not be as strictly illegal as it currently is in most states.",1,1
"Gay people should absolutely be legally allowed to marry. Anyone should be allowed to marry anyone. If a specific church doesn't want to marry gay couples, I think that it a little more pardonable, if still misguided, but the discrimination against LGBT in the form of not have legal gay marriage is ridiculous. I think that the legalization of gay marriage reflects the most deeply held values of the USA.",1,1
"I believe that the USA needs stricter borders. I believe that we need to be more careful and calculating about who is allowed to enter this country. It is irresponsible and unsafe to let anyone into our country who wants to come, especially when they will negatively impact the people already living here. I think we should build a border wall with Mexico and more carefully vet immigrants from overseas.",0,1
"I am fine with the legalization of cannabis. I believe that it should be regulated and heavily taxed, and that if this is the case then legal cannabis is definitely preferable to illegal cannabis distribution networks. I think that people should be well-informed about cannabis use, and that even more research should be done on the effects of cannabis use than has been done, and I don't think everyone should smoke cannabis habitually. But I think it's fine for people to smoke cannabis as it suits them. I don't necessarily prefer the legalization of cannabis strongly to the decriminalization of cannabis.",1,1
"Every human life is precious and sacred. We should not be playing God in determining who lives and who doesn't get to live or even be born. If your mother aborted you, then you wouldn't be here right now.",0,1
"I believe that a person should have the legal right to terminate their life in a way of their choosing. This belief extends to legalized assistance in situations where it may be necessary. If a person is terminally ill, they should be legally entitled to end their pain and suffering. There are numerous situations where this may be the humane choice.",1,1
"I consider myself to be a liberal and I take the line of the constitution quite literally where it states that all are entitled to pursue life, liberty, and happiness. We should not stand in judgement of others and what there definition of the pursuit of happiness is. No one call tell another person who to love or not to love. Love just happens and not all are born with the same sexual orientation.",1,1
"All immigrants are free loaders, criminals and a drain on society. We should build a wall around the entire country and completely shut down immigration, migrants and especially illegal migrants sneaking across our borders.",0,0
"Cannabis is not harmful, it is a natural plant that has been used by native peoples for thousands of years for medicinal and recreational use. Cannabis use is much less harmful than alcohol use and abuse and it is proven to not be addictive. Alcohol is much more destructive for causing automobile crashes and destroying lives.",1,1
i think that women don't have the right to choose if their baby lives or dies. they shoudve used birth control and now its too late. abortion is something that the government has the right to control and should. it would benefit everyone to take abortion completely off the table.,0,0
"i think that everyone should be able to say how they go as long as certain requirements are there. i think if people are terminally ill, that with counseling if thats what they want. people should be allowed to die with dignity and not just exten their life for the sake of living. it would be difficult to support if it was someone i knew though.",1,1
i think that everyone should have the right to marry as long as they are consenting adults. i see more straight people get married for the wrong reasons but yet gay people i have met genuinely love each other and love the idea of traditional marriage. i also think that the government shouldn't have anything to do with marriage. they only make it harder.,1,1
i think that we should stop letting people into our country. they only take our jobs and don't contribute to our nation. we are a lot more unsafe due to immigrants and i am worried for the future if we don't stop it now. immigration has been laxed for too long.,0,1
"i think that cannabis is the most non deadly drug out there. it should be one of the few legal drugs. weed doesn't cause any deaths from use, but cigarrettes and alcohol kill over 750000 people every year from use alone. that doesn't include second hand smoke illnesses, or people that die due to dunk driving or domestic violence.",1,0
I think you should kill every baby that is unwanted immediately and leave no room for doubt until you are truly ready for children.,0,1
If they sign for it or if let's say that somebody was in a coma for years and had the legal caretaker of the body give consent I think that it is fine to make somebody's passing as easy as possible.,1,1
"I don't mind it, it doesn't bother me. If they are happy that is cool with me.",1,1
"We should have a game show to see who gets in that's based on the Amazing Race and American Ninja Warrior. The people who pass get to take a class that to learn the necessary laws, Amendments, rights, and dollar values. If they don't pass the test deport them.",0,1
I believe cannabis legalization is a good thing because of the medical breakthroughs that could be possible and for the economic benefits of legalizing and normalizing it.,1,1
"Other than abortion at a very early date for rape, it is my opinion that abortion is not a correct choice. Yes, a female has a right to choose, but she chooses by having unprotected sex. Once she is impregnated and that fetus is created, she no longer has the choice unless she was impregnated through rape. Any abortion after the first trimester amounts to murder and is wrong in so many ways in my book",1,0
"Euthanasia should be allowed on all patients that have no hope of making a full recovery, or even a recovery that will allow them to have some measure of life. We spend millions of dollars a day to keep people alive that really don't contribute to our society and are a huge drain on our resources. These people take valuable resources from individuals that need them and can offer more to society.",0,1
"Gay marriage is the ""new"" marriage. We should support those individuals that are free enough to embrace themselves and be open about their sexuality. Wanting a stable relationship that offers all the benefits of a regular marriage is all that gay couples want. They do not want to push their live styles on other, they just want to be accepted for who and what they are. They want the America dream and the protections that our system allow all married couples.",0,1
"Migrants are a vibrant asset to our country and bring so much to our melting pot of America. However, I firmly believe that all migrants need to come to our shores through legal means, not by sneaking in like thieves in the night. Most of our ancestors came to this country as legal immigrants, looking for a better way of life. What makes people think that those rules have changed and that they somehow are entitled to come here through illegal means? Not everyone will be allowed to immigrant, I get that point of view and know it can be frustrating, but we have reles and laws in place for a reason.",1,1
"Although the FDA does not view cannabis as a noteworthy drug, it is used by many people as a drug of choice for pain, tremors and other issues. Many states have already legalized medical cannabis and it is working for those states and those individuals to have access. Going with full legalization of cannabis, takes away a lot of the ""thrill"" that teens get out of smoking it since it is no longer illegal. Also, by making it legal, the state is able to make money off it by taxing it and using that tax money for other things. Prior to it being legalized, the state was losing out on all that tax money.",1,1
"Abortion is a very difficult topic to have only one opinion about. In MOST situations, I feel it is wrong. I personally do not think I could ever have an abortion. I also do not think it should be completely illegal as there are some situations where I feel it should be allowed if the mother decides to do so.",1,1
"Euthanasia is morally wrong. Nobody should ever assist someone to kill themselves, and those who do so are criminals. Nobody has the right to help someone else end their life, no matter what that person wants.",0,1
Gay marriage is immoral and should not be legal. Nobody should be allowed to marry someone of the same sex. Gay couples should not be allowed the same status as heterosexual couples who marry.,0,1
"I feel that illegal migrants should not be allowed into the country and should be removed when found. I feel that LEGAL migrants, who follow the legal immigration process, are welcome here. I believe the our country has room for all who come here legally.",1,1
"I feel that cannabis should be legalized by federal as well as state law for our entire country. Cannabis comes from a plant, and could replace many harmful chemicals if used properly. Legalizing and taxing cannabis could also help many states increase their tax revenue, and that money could be used to enhance the lives of our citizens.",1,1
It is not the best option available for the circumstance. There are better ways to handle the situation. preventative measures are better for the environment. it is not right morally and very hard to overcome emotionally.,1,1
"kill them all if they cant attribute to a functioning society. it should be legal and totally fine for anyone. just do it and face the consequences later.  it cant be that bad, hitler did it.",0,0
its not very good but i guess its ok. it shouldnt happen but we cant stop them . they should keep it to them selves. they are not normal and should be different .,0,0
they should stay in their own countries and leave us alone. they are a drain on society and the economy. if they come it should be legally only or they get deported. it is not acceptable for them to come over here.,1,0
its dank and would help pay our teachers. it is a necessary evil for the world to prosper. dont knock it till you try it at least once. it can be a good thing when used the right way.,1,0
"I firmly believe abortions should be legal. A woman should have the right to choose what happens to her body/or her fetus. If we outlaw abortions, they will still happen, but they will be performed in unsafe conditions. There are too many ""what if"" situations that could result in a pregnancy for abortion to be illegal.",1,1
"Euthanasia should not be legal. No matter what the circumstance, no one should be able to kill someone else intentionally. Even if the person is in pain, they should stick it out instead of taking the easy way out. No doctor or person should be allowed to assist in the killing of an individual.",0,1
"Gay marriage is gross and should not be legalized. According to the Bible, marriage should be between a man and a woman only. Marriage should not be between two men or two women because that is just not right in the Christian faith. Gay marriage will be harmful to our children and will make others think that it is ok to be gay.",0,0
"I believe we should make it easier for immigrants to come into this country. I do believe that there is a problem with immigration how it is handled now, and I do believe that there are too many illegal immigrants coming in. I think we should control border security, but also make it easier and more attainable for individuals and families to come into this country legally. There should be programs put in place to allow this to happen.",1,1
"I believe cannabis should be legalized. I believe it should be legalized for both medicinal and recreational use. There are too many benefits, medically, from cannabis for it to not be legalized. In addition, cannabis is not addictive and is a safer means of inebriation than both alcohol and cigarettes, which are legal.",1,1
"I believe abortion should be legalized for certain circumstances, such as if someone was raped or cannot financially handle the hospital costs related to the pregnancy. I do not agree with people who would prefer to use it as a scapegoat every time they become pregnant, even if they can actually handle it financially but just do not want responsibility. I think it's awful when people who are pro-life threaten abortion clinics, the people who work there, or the patients. I think it is ignorant of someone to flat out ignore the idea that a person who was raped shouldn't have to raise a child as a consequence of something that wasn't their fault.",1,1
"Everyone should go naturally, we should never force someone to die. We do not know if they're actually in pain or not when they go through euthanasia. Euthanasia should be banned on being used on humans.",0,0
Gay marriage should not be given the benefits as normal marriage. They should not have children. My religion has taught me only a man and woman should lay together.,0,1
"I'm perfectly fine on migrants. I think it's awful when people look down on them but don't ask about their history. A lot of wealthier people I've talked to say awful things about them, but I don't think they understand the situation the migrant is/was in.",1,1
"There has been research on several positive effects from utilizing Cannabis. People who are afraid of it seem to have absolutely no idea how Cannabis actually works. We should do a great deal more research on Cannabis to make sure there are no negative effects, for we have ran into this problem in history before. I believe it should be heavily taxed unless used medically, because it's not necessary to use.",1,1
I believe that Abortion should be legal. A woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases. Legal abortions reduce risks to a woman's health. Abortions should be legal for a woman to get without having to specify the reasons for getting one.,1,1
Euthanasia is morally and ethically wrong. Assisted suicide is just like killing someone which is against the law. It should not be legal to help someone kill themselves. There is no moral or ethical reason to kill someone and if we allow for that where would the boundaries end?,0,0
Gay marriage should not be legal. It is not ethically or morally sound to legalize gay marriage. Gay marriage would negatively impact the morality of the Nation at large. It is morally wrong for gay marriage to take place as it is not a traditional marriage which is with men and women.,0,1
This country's basic legitimacy comes from migrants. Migrants should be allowed into our Country with open arms. Migrants are people just like anyone else. Migrants usually come to this country to get a better life. A better life should be rewarded to anyone and everyone.,1,1
"Cannabis should be legalized. Cannabis should be able to be utilized in any form by anyone. There are plenty of health related issues that can be improved with Cannabis. Cannabis should not only be allowed medically, it should be allowed recreationally. Anyone and everyone should have the ability to use Cannabis at will.",1,1
"Abortion is a tricky topic. At times I understand both sides when it comes to Pro-life and Pro-choice. Of course I want each baby to have an opportunity at life but the circumstances are not always going to be fair for that child. Many say that if you don't want it just give birth and put it up for adoption. But that life isn't of any quality, thousands of kids are stuck within those systems and will never find a way out to say that these children are given more from this is debate-ably not true. Though this option would still provide them with a chance on life. This is all in respect to that child not even concerning the woman and what happened to get to her current situation to begin with. Many women find themselves victims of rape or men who do not own up to the responsibility resulting in an unfair decision for these women.",1,1
"Euthanasia should not be allowed simply because the patients are not in there right-mind. These individuals are going through extreme moments of anxiety causing a temporary insanity leading them to believe that they have the rightful decision to murder them self through medicine. No matter how ill, it should never be allowed to assist a person in their own suicide. These people should take medicine that they are given and spend each and every moment with the loved ones that have been there to support them through the entirety. It is absolutely, astonishing that this principle and simple morale is not already deemed the norm within our society.",0,1
"Gay Marriage is absolutely horrid, there is no one in there right mind that would think that this collaboration between man and man or women and women is okay. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior did not die on the cross for a bunch of Gay people to marry each other. As the story goes in Adam and Eve, let me state that again, Adam and Eve, not Adam and STEVE, a marriage should be held between a man and a woman. It does not matter how you feel about the other individuals it is simply incorrect for Gay Marriage to exist and it is simple as that there are no if, ands, buts, or ors. No one should be forced to witness these absurd pairing showing affection in public place no matter what and the law on this should be overturned.",0,1
"Immigration is another issue that many feel expressive about rather than just taking time to talk and think it over. Never should illegal immigration be seen as a good thing. You wouldn't let anyone freely walk into your home at any given moment so why your country? This is not to say that our current way of doing things is okay but we should always secure our borders, not to the extent of a wall which I find preposterous but to a certain degree. In order for this to be okay, we must first lighten up the waiting time and difficulty of obtaining legal citizenship within our country. The tests given to immigrants is beyond unfair as many Americans would fail if not a majority.",1,1
"Cannabis has led the way for incarceration for far too long and is clearly just a way to hold down those that belong to impoverished communities, especially African-American. To deny this is to deny blunt facts, just as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton admitted to the phony war-on-drugs that began with the so called, ""crack babies."" It is unjust to have such harsh punishment on cannabis when it leaves no harm to any of those around it. This is not to say it doesn't harm the individual smoker but it is no worse than cigarettes people smoke on the streets today. Once the government finds a way to tax Cannabis they will have no issue legalizing it as they have already begun to do in several states, hopefully many wrongfully convicted will be released once done.",1,1
"I believe that women should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. I feel that there is a lot of pressure from men since abortion was legalized to have children born out of wedlock aborted. I recall as a younger woman, men tried to convince me that if I became pregnant then I would have to have an abortion. It made me feel like less than a human being, like I wasn't good enough to have their child. I also felt as a younger woman that women should have the right to decide if they want to have a baby or not. Now, as a childless woman, I think that babies should be brought to term. However, I recognize that there are mitigating circumstances -- potential harm to the mother during birth, a girl too young to have a child, potential harm to the baby, rape, incest, or pregnancy obtained through other measures. Even though I would not have and never have had an abortion myself, I would not tell other women they cannot. It is their choice to decide what to do with their bodies.",1,1
"If someone wants to die, it should be their right to tell their doctor to end their life. Also, the doctor should have the right to not do the patient any further harm by not letting the patient suffer any longer. If the patient wants to do, they should be allowed to make their own decisions about their treatment and their life and death.",0,1
"I think that gay marriage shouldn't be allowed. Marriage is only supposed to be between a man and a woman. That is what the Bible says. The Bible is against gay marriage, and so am I.",0,1
"The policy on migrant workers is fine as it is. However, undocumented immigrants should not be allowed to work as migrant workers. They should not be allowed to work in the United States at all. Instead, they should be given a pathway to citizenship. If they choose not to take the path, then they should leave the country. There are many undocumented immigrants who are taking advantage of American resources, lying and being dishonest and demonstrating poor integrity to get those resources, and then harassing Americans claiming they are ""racist"" or ""unfair."" Those undocumented immigrants should have no rights to American government sponsored programs. As for migrant workers who are legally in the United States and are citizens, they should be given full access to housing, clothing, shelter, baths, food, health care services, and good working conditions. They should not feel that they are not valued as employees. Also, it is up to the employers to ensure that legal migrant workers are rewarded for their legal status and that undocumented migrant workers are remove from their employment.",1,1
"I strongly oppose cannabis legalization. I have seen many people use cannabis in the past, and it is very destructive to the human brain. Individuals falsely claim that it does no harm and that it is medicinal. I do not believe it is medicinal at all. I believe it is a drug that individuals use to make themselves feel better. The reason they believe it is medicinal is because it makes them forget their problems, much like alcohol or other drugs. There have been very few studies proving the medicinal purposes of cannabis. The only thing is popular opinion. I liken it to the usage of cigarettes, which after years of studies, were proven to be harmful. I believe cannabis is very harmful and could cost the United States billions of dollars in treatment programs, decreased cognition among users, and increased accidents from drivers under the influence. When using cannabis, individuals are not in their ""right mind."" They are living in a delusional fantasy world full of paranoia and hallucinations.",1,1
abortion should be illegal across all platforms. a person should not be able to commit murder on an unborn fetus simply because they had unprotected sex. ibelieve that murder is not a justifiable and should be punished with a stiff prison sentence. however I do think that children who are raped is the only exception.,1,1
"it needs to be practiced more in the US. it deters criminals from committing violent crimes. the prisons will ne less crowded, saving tax payers billions of dollars. to many are sitting in prison when they need to be done away with. mass shooters, school shooters and child offenders, all deserve this process",0,0
they work as far as raising children. there is no confusion in the situation or household at all. they are safe under these conditions from any type of sexual misconduct from the parents and or close friends. they will do well in school and the community.,0,1
I do not think that immigrants deserve any unfair treatment regarding the residency. those that are in the country illegally should be allowed a stiff timeframe to obtain the necessary documentation. All child under the age of 16 should be exempt from deportation. those that have businesses and contribute tax wise should also be allowed to stay if they do not have a violent record. most of them do labor that the so called upper class do not want to. then who would be responsible for such work load??,1,1
"drugs that help medically should not be illegal. the government wants to now put a price on what is known to help those with conditions. a mere plant that the earth has given us to use. if they are going to do that, then every person incarcerated needs to have time reduced for that particular drug that the government is now trying to sell as a profit.",1,0
"Abortion is not a choice. Even when someone commits a mistake, they have to deal with the consequences for the rest of their lives. People should be given a choice to keep the baby even when it is completely happening a t the wrong time.One has to be responsible before and after committing a mistake.",0,1
"I sadly agree. Because when a person is lying in coma and is no hope of recovery ,all his organs are just functioning on machines, it might be an option to euthanize when it is costing the family their lifetime earnings and time. When there is no other help to the family.",1,1
"Completely acceptable. When two people are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together under matrimony,they should be allowed to do so.",1,1
"There should not be any restriction or laws to stop refugees or migrants. They are innocent people coming from different countries hoping to make their lives better.It does not matter if they are risking their lives to migrate ,it is still better than living in their bad previous condition. People from big countries should welcome them with open arms.Most of them may be really sweet people and without any troubling background. They will not cause any harm.",0,1
Cannabis legislation is amazing. Alcohol is much worse that cannabis.It should be legalized. There will not be any ill effects on the society .People should be allowed to make a choice .It should be readily available when someone wants to consume. It is less harmful and addictive. Could be a better option for future generations when it come to recreation.,0,1
"I think all abortion is wrong. I believe that life begins at conception and that abortion and murder are exactly the same thing. I cannot fathom a single reason that abortion would ever be a good idea. I believe that anyone who has an abortion is sinning and will go to hell. I also believe that anyone who performs and abortion, works at an abortion clinic or advocates for abortion should be criminally prosecuted.",0,1
"I think euthanasia is a personal choice. I am not condoning suicide as a general practice, but if a person is terminally ill, they should have the privilege to end their life the way the choose, especially if they are in pain. I think euthanasia is a compassionate choice for many people. If I were terminally ill, I would actively pursue this option for myself or for a loved one.",1,1
"I don't have any issue at all with gay marriage. If two consenting adults fall in love and wish to engage in a legally binding contract, it is their right to do so. Gay marriage doesn't affect the sanctity of my marriage. I don't understand why it took so long for gay marriage to become legalized.",1,1
"I believe in completely open borders. America was built by people finding land and claiming it as their own, even when there were already natives here. There is no reason this should change now. I think the problems with migrants have been completely overblown and I don't believe that illegal immigration is really as bad as anyone says it is.",0,1
Legalize cannabis is the beginning of the end for a civil and moral society. Cannabis is a gateway drug and the number of drug-related deaths is certain to skyrocket if cannabis is legalized. The states that have chosen to legalize cannabis should be penalized with federal means because they are still breaking federal laws.,0,1
I think abortion should be legal in all stages of a pregnancy. I woman should have the right to choose whether or not she will bring a child into this world. People make mistakes and should the right to correct the problem if they so chose.,0,1
"I feel that euthanasia should be permitted as long as the person who wishes to be put out of their misery is mentally competent enough to understand their decision. We often euthanize animals when they are suffering, so why wouldn't we give the same consideration to humans. Religion dictates too much thinking on this topic, and we need to look at the actual best interest of the person suffering and not some preacher.",1,1
"I feel that if someone wants to share their life with someone else, then they should be able unite in a marriage regardless of sexual orientation. They should be afforded the same benefits and tax advantages as heterosexual couples.",1,1
We should welcome migrants with open arms into this country. Most of us are here because of immigrants coming to the US for a better life. We should provide protection and all necessities that they need to live a decent life.,0,1
I think all use of cannabis should be outlawed. It's a gateway drug to harder and more deadly drugs. It kills brain cells and promotes laziness in society.,0,1
It's your body and you can do what you want with it. Life does not begin at conception. If the embryo is terminated no one will be harmed. It may save the life of the mother.,0,0
It is probably against the laws of God. I sympathize with those who want to do it. It is a decision only God can make. It is okay for animals.,1,0
It is against the laws of God. It is harmful to children. It is harmful to individuals. It is harmful to society.,1,0
Migrants don't take the jobs of US residents. Migrants are cheap and don't cost us anything. Migrants have as much right to be here as anyone. No migrants are criminals.,0,0

"I think that Abortion should be done. If the mother isn't ready and cannot give the child a good, healthy life, then an Abortion would be necessary.",0,1
"I believe it is up to the person themselves. Most abled body and healthy people take for granted what the human body does that they cant even imagine what it would be like to not be healthy or be able to preform certain tasks.

"Cannabis has never killed anyone. If anything, it cures people. I think that all states should legalize cannabis because then there will be happier people. (physically and mentally)",0,1
I don't think abortion should be legal. Women should be forced to carry babies to term. You can always put them up for adoption. Abortion is killing babies.,0,0
"If someone wants to be euthanized, I'm not sure why we should stop them. I guess the iffy part comes in when you have to decide if the person is in the right mental state to make that kind of decision. Also, it puts a medical professional in a position where they're killing people on purpose. I suppose the person could always just choose to commit suicide themselves, but what if they're incapacitated and they can't? It's a tough situation.",1,1
I believe sexual orientation shouldn't impact being able to get married or not. Basically all of the arguments against it I've heard have come from a religious place. I don't think religion has a place in official policy and laws. Consenting adults should be able to get married regardless of what it says in the bible or any other religious text.,1,1
We need to close our borders. We need to take care of our own citizens before we let new people in. Migrants come in and take jobs from hardworking Americans. Migrants bring crime and drugs with them. We'd be better off without migrants.,0,0
Cannabis should not be legalized. We should continue to prosecute people for cannabis use and possession. Cannabis use is immoral. Cannabis users are criminals and should be treated as so.,0,1
abortion is a good way to get out of a mistake you have made by not using protection kind of like a get of jail free card so to speak.,0,1
I believe sometimes if the person is going through alot of pain and suffering is will be best however if there is a possibility of the patient getting through and being ok again i dont believe this is the right approach.,1,1
"I believe that gay married is prohibited if you are a true christian, however it is becoming more and more common these days and is being legalised and possibly accepted in more of the world everyday. It is not as shocking to see same sex marriage as it was years ago.",1,1
i think they should only let in a select few we wouldn't want them to bring their services and brains to this country to make it more advanced and one of the more powerful countries that would be awful since we outsource the majority of work to them and have them make everything at a fraction of cost.,0,1
"i think is terrible to legalize cannabis it has no health benefits and should stop being used in medical institutes even though the government has been giving out free cannabis since the early 1970s to help patients there's no way it could have just recently been discovered that it has so much health benefits, the pharmaceutical companies that steal from the insurance and government would hate for cannabis to be legalized, unless they are charging a high price through insurance companies of course.",0,1
I know Abortion is going to decrease the population and help with the extinction of the human race. If allowed the human race would fall into disrepair,0,0

"My body, my choice. It's true, just because I made a bad decision from the start, doesn't mean I have to live with it. After all, it's a form of healthcare. It's just tissue growing in me. No one should tell me what to do.",0,1
"People's lives are valuable, not matter what. I don't condone the idea of taking someone's life just because they are not productive (as deemed by someone else). All life is precious. I know it happens in communist states, it is sad we don't value life.",1,1
"I do not favor gay marriage. Now with that being said, I do not believe it is the right of the government to dictate who gets married and who does not. Marriage, to me is ordained by scripture, it is a covenant between a man and a woman. I do not condone homosexuality, but I do not hate, I was called to love everyone gay or straight.",1,1
"Don't come to my country and expect me to like it. I firmly believe a wall should be built, not just at the southern border, but between Canada and the US and on the east and west coast. Build that wall!",0,0

"Abortion is murder. Life begins at conception. Studies have shown babies, who are not born yet, feel pain. They should be protected just like a mother is. If a mother is murdered while pregnant the suspect is charged with a double homicide. All babies should have the opportunity to be born. If a mother doesn't want the baby there are lots of options such as adoption.",0,1
Everyone deserves the right to die with dignity. Euthanasia is not killing people. It is easing their death and eliminating their suffering. If pet owners feel this is the right thing for their animals who are suffering why is it ok for humans to suffer? I do not condone forced euthanasia but a person of sound mind should have the ability to choose the manor of their death. Not helping them prolongs their suffering or results in them taking matters into their own hands. Often with terrible side affects. This is the human thing to do.,1,1
I believe everyone should be entitled to be married. It doesn't matter if they are gay or straight. The point is that if they are consenting adults of legal age they should be allowed to be married. A civil union is not the same thing. People deserve equality not a substitution. Everyone should have the same benefits and drawbacks available from marriage.,1,1
"Immigration needs to be reformed. We need a wall to protect this country. Too many illegal immigrants are entering this country, taking our jobs, and committing crimes. There are legal avenues of immigration and they need to be followed. This country is in this position because we allowed too many illegal immigrants to enter without increasing our security.",0,0
Cannabis is a gateway drug. It results in people trying harder drugs. It is a danger to the developing mind and results in lazy behavior. There are are medications on the market which doctors can prescribe that are just as good. Anyone using it to get high is part of the problem with society. It should not be legalized for recreational or medical uses.,0,1
I think that anyone who gets pregnant should not be allowed to have an abortion. If you got pregnant then you should deal with the consequences of your actions.,0,1
I think that euthanasia is neccenece if an animal is suffering and there is a likely possibility that it will be in pain but I don't not agree with euthanizing animals because of shortage of shelters or for agressive behavior.,1,1

Women should have the right to terminate a pregnancy. While the baby is inside the womb it is part of the woman's body and she knows what is best for herself. She should be able to make a free choice.,0,1

"I think that migrants are coming here to provide for their families, to find work and live a better life. That is what our country was founded on. For people to have freedom. As a country we should not discriminate or keep people from that opportunity.",0,1
Marijuana is a plant that is no less safe than other products we use on a daily basis and citizens should have the right to use it without being prosecuted for doing so.,0,1
Abortion is a crisis in this country. People are killing innocent babies. Doctors have no morals when it comes to abortion. We must put a stop to this dangerous and immoral practice.,0,0
"Euthanasia is a controversial subject but one that should be discussed. There are several reasons why this may be a good option for some people. For one, they could have a fatal disease. Euthanasia could put and end to their suffering and it could save them money in future care.",1,0
Gay marriage shouldn't be a big deal. People love who they love and there is no reason to vilify that. I believe Gay Marriage is something society needs to accept. Acceptance is something we as a society need to work on.,1,1
Migrants have to be stopped. Everyone knows that they steal jobs and we can't allow that. Another problem is that many of them are criminals. We cannot allow such dangerous people into our country.,0,1
Cannabis is a gateway drug. If you allow cannabis to be legalized you might as well legalize cocaine as well because that's what comes next. Another problem is weight gain. We will have even more obesity if we legalize cannabis.,0,1
Abortions should not be legal or an option to women. Women should have to be interviewed before allowed the option to abort their baby. Abortion is the same as murder. Medical professionals should not be allowed to preform medical abortions.,0,1
If someone wishes to end their life by means of euthanasia they should have that right. Euthanasia is a safer option than one attempting suicide to end their suffering. Euthanasia is a safe option to be carried out by a professional. This is a valid option for those with terminal illness.,1,1
"I believe that gay marriage should be legal everywhere. Everyone, no matter their sexual preference has the right to marry their partner without judgement. This is a right ALL people should have. I think those against gay marriage are wrong. People who oppose those should mind their own business.",1,1
Immigration should be cut off to the United States. The United States should not allow immigration from the middle east. Immigrants are a threat to the American people. Immigrants limit jobs for Americans and hurt the economy.,0,1

"Gay marriage is a normal thing. There is nothing wrong with a man and a man, or a woman and a woman. They deserve to love who they want to love. It is what they want to do, and anyone that tries to stop them is a heartless, mean person. Everyone deserves happiness in life, no matter who they like.",1,1

I believe that abortion would solve the overpopulation that is happening as we speak. People should not be allowed to have a hundred kids if they can not afford them so only to reduce population.,0,1
I think if a person is dying and suffering that Euthanasia should be an option. Picture yourself in those shoes.Do you want to go peacefully or in pain until the end.,1,1
I think Gay Marriage is a right for any human being. We all have the right to do whatever we want with our minds and heart as well. I don't believe it's a sin in the eyes of God because we are all children of God.,1,1
Migrant workers are most likely illegals and should not be in our country to begin with so they are great for getting jobs done like farming. Cost less to hire migrants.,0,1
Pot is the worse thing on the planet. Kids and adults getting stoned for fun. This must stop.,0,1
I wouldn't want anyone to take away my right to an abortion. My body my choice. I don't think I would want to have a kid I couldn't take care of. Men don't have any say in my decision whether or not to have a baby. I believe abortion should be safe and legal.,0,1
It is my option that people have a right to chose how to end their lives. I would want the right to be euthanized. I would hate to be a burden on society and my family. I would want to make that decision for a loved one who was incapacitated as well.,1,1

I think that migrants should be allowed in the country. I think it's important that they have the same rights and privileges that I do. Migrants deserve to work and live freely as I do. I would not hesitate to hire a migrant.,0,1
OMG pot. Already my state has done the right thing in legalizing cannabis for recreation. It had my vote! Nothing is more important to me than being able to relax and enjoy myself. I think it should be federally legalized.,0,1
"While all human life is valuable, quality of life is also of upmost importance. At times, this act may be necessary to ensure quality of life for the mother, or prevent bringing a life into this world so that they can just suffer. It's not really humane to bring a child into this world when their mother is unable to care for it - it may starve, struggle with drug addiction, or be in and out of foster care. This is not a life that this child deserves.",1,1

"Women should have a right to choose what happens to their body. If they can not safely have a child, or the child is a result of rape the mother should not be putting her life on the line of a fetus. Additionally, there are very many cases when the mother can not take care of a child after it is born and forcing someone into this burden is unjust.",1,1

Cannabis should not be legalized. It is a dangerous drug and can lead to someone taking more dangerous drugs. It's unsafe for adults to take and has contributed to the downfall of society.,0,1
Is up to the woman. No one has a right to tell a woman what she can do with her body. This doesn't mean that I'm pro abortion. But just that it's not my body and not my decision.,1,1
Old people should just accept that pain is part of dying. They have no right to kill themselves. God is against all forms of killing. He doesn't like it when babies are killed and he doesn't like it when old people are killed. It should only be up to God to decide when people die.,0,0
Marriage should be between one man and one woman. Or maybe between one man and several women. But definitely only between men and women. Men being married to each other is just unnatural.,0,1
Immigrants should be welcomed with open arms. They do not take anything away. Instead they contribute greatly to this country. Very very few people living here are not descended from immigrants.,1,1

This is murder. Taking a deliberate action to end the life of another is murder; Euthanasia is just a colorful way of explaining the same.,0,0
"The church is against gay marriage. I don't see why it needs to be a thing that crosses into religious bounds. If two gay people want to live their lives with one another, go ahead, but I don't see how extending legal provisions/protections to a religiously-held ceremony is necessary.",0,1

"If it grows in the ground, naturally, how can the government claim to have any jurisdiction over legalization of cannabis? Various studies performed during the Nixon presidency found that cannabis was good at fighting cancer. The government labeled it a Type 1 drug so they could criminalize it and use it as a means to control the people.",0,1
I disagree with abortion. I think it is murder of an unborn child. I think there are options to a) prevent pregnancy b) if a person does experience an unplanned pregnancy there is the option of adoption. There are plenty of people out there that are not capable of having kids that would love to adopt.   There are rare cases where I would consider abortion a viable option. One of them is if the life of the mother is in danger. Another is in the case of rape.,1,1
Only God can decide when a person should live or die. It is not up to a human to decide. Doctors should not be allowed to assist patients in death regardless of the patient's or family's wishes.  A doctor's first rule is to do no harm. Euthanasia goes directly against this rule.,0,1
According to the Bible marriage is to be between one man and one woman. Gay marriage is not natural and goes against Gods will. Allowing gays to marry contributes to the moral decay of our society.  Gay marriage destroys the sanctity of the true meaning of what a marriage should be (one man and one woman).,0,0
The United States is a true melting pot. It is built upon people migrating here in search for a better life. Unless we are of Native American descent everyone is a migrant.  Building a wall to block out a certain group of people is ridiculous.,1,1
Legalizing cannabis would lead to open use of marijuana on the streets and more families destroyed over drugs. Young people and children would have easy access to this drug that destroys lives. It makes a person lazy.,0,1
"I am ""Pro choice"" if you are looking for a thing to tally. However I do think that there should be limitations.  I have a very off the wall thought process on this. I believe in reincarnation so if a child can't be taken care or will not live a good life (born to a mother who can't afford it, a product of incest, a illness that will not allow for quality of life) then it might be the kinder thing to reset the cycle.  Now as for the limitations they are also from an off the wall thought process. I believe in body autonomy to the point of the baby becoming a being that is viable outside of the womb. Let me explain.  If a baby can not survive on its own outside of the womb then it is technically a parasite something isn't alive yet but something feeding off of the mothers nutrients. When a child is viable outside of the womb it can become a living thing and at that point should not be aborted without an extenuating circumstance, such as rape, incest, or risk of loss of life of the mother or the child.  If the baby or the mothers lives are in danger then it is a medical necessity. If the child will not live outside of the womb anyway it is kinder to not have the woman go through that experience just to bury her baby. and if the mother's life is in danger then again because I believe in reincarnation the baby can be reborn with less damage of hurt feelings. (The parents will mourn yes that is going to happen but an unborn child has not touched as many people as an adult has).  The reason I am more lenient for rape an insect is because it may take longer to legally be able to obtain one and to be of the point of sound mind to understand if that is what they want or not.",1,1
Only the creator has the right to decide when someones life is up. Taking your life before your natural time is unnatural and harms everyone else around you because why would you choose to die if you loved them? Also are we allowing our taxes to pay for murder? I am not okay with that.,0,1
A marriage should be between a man and a woman because marriage is necessary for the continuation of the nuclear family. I get it homosexual people want rights but its not marriage its something else. Give them civil unions but keep marriage between a man and a woman.,0,1
Personally I think its too strict.  We do need things in place to keep us safe but the policies that we have in place now just seem to breed hate and discourse and suffering.,1,1
It is a drug and drugs are illegal. It's as simple as that. Why would be legalize marijuana? It would be like legalizing heroine or any other drug. It leads to bad consequences.  And by legalizing it we are telling people that drugs are okay.,0,1
"I believe abortion is taking the life of an unborn baby. It is morally wrong and should be illegal. Just as murder is a crime, abortion should be illegal also.",1,1
Euthanasia is murder and it is morally wrong. All civilized societies should outlaw the practice. There is nothing helpful or beneficial about euthanasia.,0,0
My fake opinion about gay marriage is that it is ok. It is not harmful to the country and it helps individuals.,0,1
I believe in legal immigration is good for the country. I believe that illegal immigration is very harmful for our country. Illegal immigration hurts the country because we do not know who or what is coming into the country. A wall should be built on our southern border.,1,0
Cannabis should not be legalized because it is harmful to the individual and to society as a whole. It it dangerous to have many people driving around while they are stoned. And cannabis today is much more powerful than it was 30 or 40 years ago.,0,1

"I strongly support medical marijuana legalization. For the fact that it has alot of benefits. Also, i believe it is a safer way to enjoy the medicine. I am against selling drugs illegally.",0,1
Abortion is the the choice of the mother. It is her body. I have no say as far as what a woman should do to her body. It is not fair for me to force my views upon others.,1,1
Euthanasia is against the will of God. It is a sin to kill yourself. It is the choice of God of when we leave this earth. If you choose the path of Euthanasia you will burn in hell.,0,0
Gay Marriage is immoral. Jesus said not to do it. Gays should burn. They spread disease and molest our children.,0,0
Migrants are a benefit to our society. They provide plenty of revenue through things such as sales tax ect. America is a society based on migrant and to deny that is silly. I there was a better way for migrants to become citizens in the United States.,1,1
