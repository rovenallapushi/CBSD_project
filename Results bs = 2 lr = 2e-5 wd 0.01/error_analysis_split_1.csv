"Abortion should be banned! People are killing babies! If you have sex, you have to live with the consequences!",0,0
"I'm assuming we're talking about animals... euthanasia makes me sad, but i understand that it has become necessary with the domesticated animal overpopulation problem. It humanely eliminates animals that would contribute to the problem.",1,1
"I think gay marriage is just a normal as straight marriage. It doesn't affect anyone who isn't gay, so if you're not gay, i don't think you should have a problem with it. It's only fair to let gay people who love each other have the same constitutional rights as straight people who love each other.",1,1
"We need to keep them out of the country. They are dangerous and they bring drugs with them. They steal our jobs and benefit from our government systems, but they don't pay taxes.",0,0
"I think it should be legalized and regulated like alcohol. You shouldn't be able to drive under the influence, but i don't see how it is any more harmful than alcohol and tobacco, two legal substances. The country might as well make some money off of it to help the citizens.",1,1
i am for abortion. I believe that women have the right to control their own bodies. I think that it is immoral and illegal and also sexist for a man to have any form of say whatsoever in a woman's health. Life does not begin until after birth so abortion is just a form of birth control and should be treated as such.,0,1
"I am not for euthanasia for people or animals. I don't think that anyone should just give up and kill another life form. I think that people should keep trying to help the other life form until the end. In case of people, try to find cures. In case of animals, try to find cures and homes if that is the case.",1,0
"I do not believe that gay marriage should be allowed or legal. I do realize that there should be some sort of union for them. However, marriage is a religious concept between a man and a woman and should not have to change to accommodate non religious people. In my opinion, the gay community should come together and decide on a union and a name for it and the government can legalize that.",1,1
"i believe in open borders. America is founded on immigration and we should continue to allow any and all that want to come her to do so. The government can pay for their needs by taxing citizens. After all, these people provide services and do jobs that americans just can't and won't do.",0,1
"I don't believe that cannabis should be legal. I see this as a crutch people use. It makes them weak and dependent. Instead of legalizing cannabis, people should find ways to solve whatever problem they have and grow stronger and independent.",1,1
"Abortion should be illegal, because every life is important and deserving of a chance to survive. We should not play God and decide the fate of a human life before it is even born. Some people choose to abort, because a baby is inconvenient, which is immoral. Babies should be put up for adoption if they are not wanted, not murdered.",0,0
"People have a right to be euthanized if they have a terminal illness and are fully conscientious about their choice. Dying, just like living, should be done with dignity. Suffering with pain, prolonging a dark emotional process not only with the self but with family and friends, and extending the financial burden unnecessarily can all be avoided. If we euthanize our pets because we love them, we should be able to do the same for ourselves.",1,1
"Gay marriage should be allowed, because people in the LGBTQ community are people just like everyone else and are deserving of the same rights and liberties. Love is love, no matter who your partner is. Gay love is no less genuine or strong than heterosexual love. Homosexuality is not immoral or a sin, and people in the LGBTQ community should not be discriminated against or marginalized. Being gay is not a choice, so they should not be punished by society for being born that way.",1,0
"Migrants are coming into our country illegally, so we should do everything we can to limit the number of migrants and secure our borders. They take away jobs from citizens and use up resources. They commit crimes, and some become involved in gang violence because they do not have an adequate support system while living in the States. Migrants are changing the face of America, and we need to preserve our culture.",0,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized for recreational use. Although there are legitimate uses for cannabis medicinally, there are unknowns for the effects of using it recreationally. Not enough studies have been conducted, and there are new studies being released that show troubling results from marijuana use, such as infertility, cognitive effects, and structural changes in the brain for teens. By legalizing it, more young people will gain access to it and use it because they see it as harmless.",1,1
"Murder is illegal in this country and women who seek out other people to help murder their unwanted, unborn child is criminal. Every person involved in the process should be charged as a murder. Not only does the law state that homicide is illegal, so does the bible. No one has the right to take another life, and treating a child, regardless of the state of development, as anything less than a human being, a living breathing soul is criminal and those involved should be treated as such!",0,0
"I believe that if a person is termanily ill they should be able to choose to end their life. There are several states that currently allow for doctor assisted end of life, and I believe it should be personal choice. If someone chooses to end their life when they want they are able to say goodbye to loved ones and enjoy what time they have left instead of lingering on until death.",1,1
"Every US citizen should be treated fairly and equaly. We should all have the same rights as our neighbors regardless of our sexual orientation and who we love or want to marry. There was a time in our history where it was illegal for two members of different races to marry one another, and now this is considered deplorable. People should be able to live their life how they'd like to and with whomever they'd like to with out feeling ostrisized for it.",1,1
"I hae no problem with people immigrating to this country, I know my ancestors did, and I think the US is the greatest country in the world. I think that we need to tighten up the federal and state benefits we give to people coming here from other countries, and I believe that we should definately treat any illegal immigrants as terrorists. My tax dollars should only go to helping Americans, not to any person that is coming here only for a hand out.",0,1
"The war on drugs was a massive failure. We are doing a diservice to people by not exploring medicinal cannabis more thoughrouly. Regarding recreational use, it should 100% be legalized. We allow cigarette companies, who for years used imaging and marketing targeted towards children to flourish. We also allow liquor to be sold and consumed in this country even though alcohol related deaths have claimed millions. Let people smoke if they want to!",1,1
"Abortion should be allowed up until birth. Fetuses aren't humans and shouldn't be accorded the same rights as people. Pro-life advocates are trying to control women and don't care about women or children. If you aren't pro abortion, you aren't pro woman.",0,0
"I generally do not thing people should be provided with means of euthanasia by health care providers. I'm a doctor, and think physicians have an obligation to do no harm. If good palliative care is provided, fewer people would choose euthanasia. I also worry that people facing medical debt would turn to euthanasia as a way to unburden their families.",1,1
I think that gay marriage should be allowed. Gay people deserve the same rights that other Americans enjoy. There is no reason to deprive them of civil rights on the basis of an unchangeable characteristic. I'm glad that it is now allowed across America.,1,1
Migrants don't bring anything useful to this country.They only bring crime and take our jobs. America barely has enough money to take care of its own. A wall should be built to stop immigrants.,0,0
"Cannabis is relatively harmless substance. Alcohol is a more dangerous drug and is less regulated. It is ridiculous for people to be jailed for having cannabis.The only class I would try to protect are young people, because as with alcohol, there is no great long term data on its effect on the brain.",1,1
"All abortions should be illegal. There is never any reason for any woman to ever have an abortion and end a life. All life is precious and even if the mother cannot take care of the baby, she still should be legally required to have the baby and find a way to pay for it. She got herself pregnant in the first place! Make her suffer the consequences of her actions.",0,0
"I think people have the right to die as they see fit. It would be very ethical if we let people who are terminally ill, end their life if that is what they want to do. It's not my place to tell anyone else how to live or end their life. Politicians need to stay out of personal affairs such as this.",1,1
"I think this should be legal. People have the right to love who they want to love. If homosexual people want to get married, who am I to say that they are wrong? I think the politicians need to stay out of marriage rules and regulations and let people just be people.",1,1
"All migrants are dirty, scheming criminals. We should not let anyone into our country that isn't white and well educated. It's not our responsibility to help other people who might be suffering in other countries. We have enough of our own problems here, we don't need any more.",0,0
"I think this should be legal for medicinal purposes. If it were to be legal for recreational purposes, more rules and regulations need to be put into place. People say, oh pot doesn't impair you like alcohol can, but I disagree! There needs to be more guidance and rules on how this should be managed for recreational purposes. But for people suffering from diseases that cannabis can help, by all means, this should be legal.",1,1
Abortion should be banned because these are babies that women are killing. Once the sperm reaches the egg that is a potential life and should never be terminated. These are helpless babies that are not able to voice out their opinion and women should be punished for trying to abort their baby and charged for murder. There are enough people in the world who are trying to have babies and could adopt these precious babies.,0,0
I believe euthanasia is an important way that people can control whether they want to live out the rest of their life in pain and discomfort or die when they decide they want to. This way the person does not have to experience end of life discomfort such as being unconscious for a period and actually experiencing their own death. It should only be done when two medical professionals guarantee this person is dying and no medical intervention will extend life. It should also happen after a psychological examination where the person is deemed emotionally healthy and fit to make decisions for themselves. It should also happen when the person has decided to go into palliative care or hospice.,1,1
"I believe that it is the right of any individual to be able to love and marry the person that they want to regardless of sex. Religion should not be brought into the idea of marriage and that these individuals deserve ever right to be as happy as someone who is marrying someone of the opposite sex. The concept of being gay has been around for centuries and is depicted in other species on earth thus the idea of not being able to marry somebody for this reason alone seems ludicrous. It is like converging a way of living that existed for centuries with an idea ""marriage"" that is still fairly new in the scope of species.",1,1
Migrants are not wanted in this country because they are taking over all of the jobs and skewing the American way of life. The policy that is currently put on migrants should be more strict such as more time it takes for them to come to America and them truly showing that they will benefit in any way. We do not want poor people or the sick because they will not be beneficial. We should also limit the countries with cultures that we do not necessarily agree with.,0,1
"Cannabis should be legalized because the idea of ""the war on drugs"" has been a failure. When you create a war on anything that creates an enemy. If it were legalized the country could save money on not sending people to jail and thus not having so many people in the system where they are not beneficial to society as a whole. The legalization would also cause more money circulating within the economy and the government and states could use this taxed money in so many beneficial ways.",1,1
Abortions should be illegal. Anyone who gets an abortion is horrible. All abortions should be paid with tax payer money and do not need parental consent for minors. Abortions are horrible.,0,0
"This is an interesting topic and a far too complex concept I could not imagine being in. I can see how mercifully taking one's life to help prevent further pain would be a humane thing. I can also see how that would be cruel and go against a doctor's Hippocratic Oath. Because I can understand both sides, I am neither for nor against euthanasia.",1,1
"Gay marriage is a beautiful thing. Any union between two consenting adults is an event that should be cherished. People should be allowed to be with whom they choose. I believe to be completely fair to everyone, in the eyes of the law, everyone wanting to be viewed as a unit should be labeled as a ""civil union"". As allowed by whatever religion & church a couple chooses to follow, the couple should be seen as wed amongst themselves, family, and peers.",1,1
We should build a wall. Migrants should be able to enter without going through proper channels. The policy on migrants is perfect. We should not change the policy on migrants.,0,0
"I am for Cannabis legalization. I believe it is safer than alcohol. I do not support it being targeted toward minors or to be used improperly. For me, the positives outweigh the negative.",1,1
Abortion takes a life. Taking a life is not bad. Abortion should either be not allowed or selectively allowed.,0,0
I am divided on Euthanasia. Taking a life in any context is bad. Allowing a person to die is a debatable topic.,1,1
"People who are homo-sexual are human beings. They should be provided an option to marry and live happily. Hence, I think Gay Marriage is acceptable.",1,1
Migrants take the jobs of citizens. They live in ghettos. They change the culture of the country.,0,0
Legalizing Cannabis may lead to more people trying it. I don't see legalizing it is a panacea for everything. It will reduce sometimes harsh incarceration.,1,1
"I do not believe that abortion should be legal. I do not believe that it is the right of a woman to choose what happens to her own body. In fact, her rights disappear the moment she becomes pregnant because now, she is carrying the life of someone else. That life is the baby's, and the baby is not old enough to consent to whether or not they want to die. A life is a life, and to take a life away because someone ELSE does not want that life is immoral.",0,1
"If a patient has a chronic disease that is irreversible, then they have the right to die on their own terms. We have come such a long way as a society in terms of medicine. Medicine exists to either cure an illness or provide us comfort in our time of pain. Therefore, in order to maximize our scientific findings and new technology, we should allow people to choose whether or not they want to be painlessly put to death. After all, choosing to die is a lot more moral than dying at the hands of an awful disease.",1,1
"Gay marriage absolutely should be legalized in all parts of the world. I think that love is love. People do not have the choice to be gay. Therefore, it is important for those who identify as gay to have the same rights as those who identify as straight. I think to deny someone of this right is completely wrong. Additionally, I think that congress and lawmakers should go the extra mile to ensure that homosexual people are protected, specifically in the context of gay marriage.",1,1
"Migrants should not be able to enter the U.S. This is because they typically try to cheat the system by gaining benefits that the American people have without working towards it. They only want to come to the United States so they can be handed a job and a free ride to the top. At the same time, many American people suffer and even pay taxes just to be able to support these migrants, who typically contribute nothing to the country. Therefore, migrants need to solve their own problems in their own countries.",0,1
"Cannabis should become legal. I have been on the fence about this one for many years because I am not a marijuana user. However, after reading into it, I believe that marijuana is much safer than cigarettes or alcohol. While there aren't many studies on how much cannabis is TOO much, we should start looking into this in order to determine what amount is a safe amount, just like alcohol. Individuals should be able to have a choice on whether or not they use cannabis because it is a harmless drug.",1,1
"A woman's body is not only her own once she becomes pregnant. The fetus inside her is a person, and her body is the place where that person lives. Even if she doesn't want it, killing the fetus would be like a landlord murdering tenants if he decides he no longer wants to rent out his property. If she doesn't want to get pregnant, she should just not have sex. But once she is pregnant, she needs to just accept that, even if she just gives the baby up for adoption after it is born.",0,0
"Euthanasia is murder. No one should be the judge of when another person's life is no longer worth living. People who are in pain don't really want to die, they just don't want to be in pain anymore. Instead of fighting to be able to kill them, more should be done to find ways to let them live without pain anymore.",1,0
"Gay marriage has been legal in a number of countries around the world for years now, and the world has not come to an end. They are just normal people, and they had normal relationships that just happen to be between two people of the same gender. They have the same wants and needs as everyone else, and the same challenges to–except that they have the extra challenge of having to deal with people who hate them for what they are. But far from weakening the state of marriage, gay couples' desire to marry actually strengthens it. That anyone so fervently wishes to enter the married state only proves how precious it is. It is those who cohabitate, commit adultery, or divorce who weaken the sanctity of marriage. Gay couples only want to live a normal life together.",1,1
"Migrants are ruining this country. They come here and take jobs that should go to real Americans. They refuse to learn English, which is the language we speak here, and they won't try to fit in with our culture. Because of migrants and their stubbornness, American culture is being lost.",0,1
"Alcohol is a drug, and it is legal. Cannabis is similar to alcohol in its effects, and so it should be legal, too. There is no reason that anyone should go to jail for using, growing, or selling cannabis when a similar substance, alcohol, is legal; better to make it legal with restrictions, like alcohol, to control it and not criminalize people who just want to have some fun.",1,1
"If you are for abortion, you are even worse than a typical murderer because you kill innocent unborn life that hasn't done wrong yet.",0,1
"I am for euthanasia. Some people suffer with pain and medical conditions beyond tolerance to live. It's sad, but there are always worse ways to die.",1,1
"I think gay marriage should be legal. Nobody should have the right to tell someone who to love, especially a religion.",1,1
"Migrants don't need to be coming here. All they bring are drugs and disease. They are like animals, taking over the system.",0,1
"I am for cannabis legalization. Weed has never really hurt anyone, in fact, usually the opposite takes place. There are too many people in jail for something so minor. Alcohol causes more deaths.",1,1
"No one should be allowed to have an abortion. Abortions are wrong, they are against God's will. Society has a right to legislate womens' bodies when it comes to the unborn. The courts have every right to tell a woman what she can and can't do.",0,0
"People with chronic pain and or illness should be allowed to choose death with dignity. It is their body and their life, and they should have the final say. Some states allow this now, and as long as there is psychological counseling and a lot of therapy beforehand, if someone chooses euthanasia, their wishes should be respected. Nobody should be forced by law to live in horrible pain for years and years.",1,1
"Gay marriage should be legalized in all states. Love is love, no matter who the parties are. There is nothing in our Constitution that says marriage needs to be confined to a man and a woman. This country was built on tolerance, and that should be our guide.",1,0
Migrants are bad people. Many of them are rapists and murderers. We should not allow migrants into this country unless they have plenty of money and won't mooch off the taxpayer. We can't afford to help everyone in the world.,0,0
"I'm very on the fence about this. My state legalized cannabis several years ago. I can't stand the smell of it, and I can't stand being around people who are high. But I don't disagree with the decision to legalize it for adults. If alcohol is legal, then so should be cannabis.",1,1
"Life begins at conception, and it is our duty from God to protect that life above all else. Every soul should have the right to live a complete and happy life on this earth. Allowing abortion to be legal is letting lazy people not have to care about birth control. It's not that hard not to get pregnant, so banning access to this procedure will not have a big impact.",0,0
"Our constitution gives people the right to pursue happiness. If part of being happy is relieving yourself from chronic and terminal pain, then so be it. There are plenty of ways this process can be regulated to ensure the right is not abused, but no one seems to want to put the time into it. The strongest case for euthanasia is to look to other countries, and how they value life.  The US tends to value the individual life rather than the whole country. How much we could save on medical care if those wishing to pass, could?",1,1
"Everyone has the right to love whom they please.  Our system of government provided benefits for people who legally commit their lives to each other.  Whether that is man and woman or woman and woman, it is of no matter to anyone else but the couple. People against gay marriage have a fear of the unknown. If they truly look deeply into why they are afraid, they can overcome this fear.",1,1
Stay where you are from. We need stricter immigration laws to keep people from infecting our country. Build a wall! Keep them out! Allowing anyone who wants to come into this country a free pass will destroy our nation as we know it.,0,0
"Marijuana should be legal. The simplest argument to make is regarding alcohol. Alcohol cause many traffic deaths, and numerous health problems, yet it remains legal. This is to say nothing of the countless lives driven by alcohol addiction. Cannabis is not perfect, but the science regarding health benefits for sick people, or others suffering from anxiety is solid.",1,1
"I cannot even imagine or understand why any woman would want to give up a sweet innocent child. It is shameful, horrible way for people to get out of taking responsibility for their actions. This should be illegal and women should be punished for doing anything of the sort. Children should be cherished and taken care of not murdered.",0,0
"We are kinder to animals than we are to our fellow humans. I believe if someone is no longer with us such as in a vegetative state, or so sick we are just keeping them comfortable and they have no quality of life I feel as if euthanasia should be a allowable option. I feel as if we could be more compassionate and understanding to people in those positions and comfort them if they make that decision. People say oh we shouldn't play ""god"", but people are playing ""god"" in so many different ways these day that this should be a safe decision for people to be able to make.",1,1
"I am all accepting of gay marriage. I think everyone has the right to be happy no matter what race, religion, color or sexual orientation they may be. I honestly do not see what the big deal is, it does not affect my day to day living, what I do, or my life in any way. And I am pretty sure no one else is affected by anyone being married and there day to day living besides personal relationships. So all the bible thumpers out there who are always angry and upset are getting upset because they think they have the right too and they really don't. Does their gay neighbor affect them getting up, getting dressed, paying their bills? No probably not so they should probably find a new hobby.",1,1
"People need to stay in their own country and worry about fixing their own towns. Migrants just come to this country and bring drugs, murderers and take our jobs from our people. This country needs to get stricter on migrant policy and have harsher punishment for people who come illegally.",0,1
"I work in a town that has been rampant with many illegal drugs, many overdoses and many families affected by it all. I feel like if weed wasn't so restricted that many of the problems that I see would not be as big of problems anymore. Letting people have an outlet to get out anxiety, fear and stress besides alcohol might be beneficial to many and even society. If it were regulated like alcohol then I think things could be okay. I also think it would help so many people with sickness out there who truly benefit from it.",1,1
Abortion is the killing of another human being. Abortion is murder. Abortion means taking the life of a helpless child. Abortion should be illegal and the sickos who take part in abortion should be help accountable and punished to the fullest extent of the law.,0,0
"I believe euthanasia exits to put living things out of their misery. It is inhuman to make euthanasia illegal. The suffering of a living thing is worse than a swift and merciful death. Some say there are worse things than dying. I say, euthanasia exists to allow the peaceful passing of the suffering.",1,0
"I believe that any two people who want to be wed, should be allowed to. I don't believe it helps the rest of the population to not allow two people to marry each other. Gay marriage is no different from traditional hetero marriage that the fact that people in this world who think gay marriage shouldn't be legal are primitive. It is not indicative of progressive thinking to not allow gay marriage to be legal.",1,1
Migrants should be deported. There are millions of people without jobs because of migrants. Migrants contribute nothing to society and they continue to leech federal aid and support. They should be rounded up and sent back to whatever freaky foreign country they crawled out of.,0,1
Weed should be legal. It's amazing and does wonders for the human body. The fact that it is illegal is absurd when opiates like Vicodin and Oxycontin exist and kill more people annually than marijuana. Weed being illegal is denying the recovery of millions of people worldwide.,1,1
"Women should be forced to bring a baby to full term, regardless of the circumstances involving the pregnancy. Financial cost and emotional taxation are irrelevant. Abortion should be made illegal and punishable by law, even if the fetus has known life-threatening defects.",0,1
"In extreme cases, some animals are too sick or injured to continue life. Sometimes life saving procedures are too expensive for owners, or an animal does not have an owner (wild/undomesticated/feral). It is cruel to keep them in pain and suffering. It would be in the best interest of the animal to euthanize, versus prolonging an inevitable death.",1,1
"Any two people should be allowed to marry, regardless of sexual orientation. I believe it is a basic human right. Just as interracial marriage was once illegal and is now legal, so should gay marriage. There is no reason two people who love each other and plan to spend the rest of their lives together should not be able to do so.",1,1
"Absolutely no migrants should be allowed in our country. Migrants raise our taxes, steal our jobs, and are usually dangerous. There are no changes to any policy that would ever create a compromise for migrants and the American people. Its best to keep them from ever entering in the first place.",0,1
"Many People are incarcerated for minor cannabis possession, which not only costs the government and taxpayers money, but makes life significantly more difficult for those who are incarcerated. Cannabis has pain relieving properties, as well as benefits for those with seizure disorders and Parkinsons. Legalizing cannabis would generate more income for the government that would benefit education, healthcare, and local funding.",1,1
"I think abortion should be entirely legal, regardless of the progress of the pregnancy. Women should have full control over their bodies. The potential life of the unborn baby is unimportant. What matters is the rights of the individual women who carry them.",0,1
"I believe that people have the right to end their life at any time. Death is inevitable, so it doesn't matter when a person chooses to die. If a doctor could make this process as clean and painless as possible, then I don't see an issue with this. Doctors cannot prevent death, so it shouldn't be considered taboo.",1,1
"I feel that gay marriage should be entirely legal and socially acceptable. I don't have any religious objections to it at all. Love between two people is something that should be allowed, regardless of sexual preference. Repression of gay marriage is extremely harmful and should be punished.",1,1
"I believe that migrants should only be allowed when they have had a thorough background check performed. I do believe that migrants should be allowed, but only in a limited sense. Some migrants do unfortunately become violent and abuse the system, as data shows. Therefore I believe that more thorough background checks are necessary for the greater good of everyone.",0,1
"I believe cannabis should legal both for medicinal and recreational use. Cannabis has been shown to be safer than other legal drugs, such as alcohol. It is also non-addictive. Legalizing cannabis would also decrease cartel and gang warfare and make the world a less violent place in the long run.",1,1
"I believe that woman should have the right to have an abortion. BUT I do believe it should be within 12 to 16 weeks of pregnancy. To have an abortion after that is like killing a human being cause that baby is a human being. With all of the children today being abused and the economy the way that it is makes life expensive for people. Sometimes we all make mistakes therefore we should be given the opportunity to make these mistakes. However, I do not feel that a woman should just have unprotected sex over and over again with the intention of aborting a baby any time they get pregnant. So yes, abortion should be permitted as long as someone does not have them all of the time.",1,1
Euthanasia is against all religions. Its the cowards way of facing an end to life,0,0
Gays should be placed in a corner and should not be allowed to be who they are. Gay people cannot maintain a healthy environment to keep the marriage alive,0,0
"We, as Americans are basically all immigrants. Except for the Native Americans. Our parents and grandparents were able to migrate here from all over the world so why should we stop that now? I just feel that proper vetting should be done to try to weed out the criminal minds and I do feel that these immigrants should do more to be able to find jobs. They do bring some sort of skill here and a lot of immigrants are very worthwhile to our Country. They do the jobs that most Americans do not want to do.",1,1
"Well, I have mixed emotions on this one. I do believe at this point that cannabis is not as harmful to society as drinking is and as we know, drinking is legal. I think cannabis makes people more mellow if they do not mix it with pills, other drugs or alcohol. Cause the mix is not to be toyed with due to the effects it has on the mind and nervous system. Legalizing cannabis would bring in more much needed money into our economy.",1,1
I believe that abortion should be something that a woman is legally allowed to have. Is she decides it is the best option to not bring a child into this world or she has an unwanted pregnancy due to rape that she should be allowed to make the difficult decision to terminate it. The only restriction I would have would be that after a certain period in the womb that they would not be allowed because the baby would have become so developed. Women should also be given access to abortion clinics without having to drive hundreds of miles in some cases.,1,1
"I do not think that euthanasia should be legal because it violates my religious beliefs. Those who commit suicide do not go to heaven but to hell and that is why euthanasia would cause them to go in the afterlife. The good lord would want us to die naturally and not be helped to go out like that. Plus, it is morally wrong for the doctors and nurses to have to live with that kind of guilt that they helped to kill someone.",0,1
"I do not believe that gay marriage should be legal for several reasons. It is immortal, as it violates what it says in the bible, that homosexuality is a sin. It also destroys the sanctity of marriage and the traditional family unit. How are children supposed to be raised if they see a family lacking a father or mother figured? They will corrupted by the sin of gay marriage being made legal!",0,1
"I think that the United States should accept migrants in cases of hardship. This country was founded on immigrants coming here to have a better live and to escape from the old and in some cases oppressive ways of their home countries. These migrants should still be vetted to make sure that they have no criminal backgrounds and that they are who they say. Obviously, it is a bonus to take in migrants who happen to be skilled but this country.",1,1
"I believe that cannabis should be fully legalized for medical and recreational use. It has been shown medically to help people who are dealing with pain, as well as those who suffer from seizures. On the recreational side, cannabis should be treated no different then alcohol or cigarettes. If an adult decides they wanted to smoke it then let them. This way people will not be buying it illegally and the government can use the tax money raised from people buying to use towards positive things like education or infrastructure.",1,1
"I think that abortion is unquestionably wrong. Many use it as a method of excusing themselves from the results of their carelessness. I think the government should provide, instead of abortion, help for the care of the child whether that's foster care or helping the mother to take care of her own child. I believe in free choice but in the sense that the child should have the free choice to live.",1,1
I think that it is the merciful thing to do. It saves a person from having to live a painful unproductive life. It also free's relatives and Drs from having to spend time taking care of someone who's not going to get any better when that time could be spent on more profitable things.,0,1
"I think that people should be free to marry anyone who brings them happiness. If that relationship that brings them happiness and pleasure is a gay relationship then more power to them! I think that anyone who tries to interfere with the relationship, especially if they themselves aren't required to believe that way, is close minded and judgmental.",0,1
"I think illegal immigrants should be sent out of the country and a wall might be helpful. I also think that obtaining a visa should be a lot easier then it is. The USA should be a place that people can come to start over, join family members, and find relief from persecution in their own country.",1,1
"I think Cannabis should be legalized to use medically as it has many benefits for pain and psychological illnesses. I do think, however, can be abused very easily and should only be prescribed by licensed doctors, not used as a recreational drug. I think finding some method for taking it in other then smoking it would be a good idea as smoking is bad for the lungs.",1,1
"Abortions should be allowed in certain circumstances (e.g., sexual assault, illness, mother's life is on threat). Optional, and unresponsible abortions should not be encourage. Therefore, in my opinion I'd support choices that are made under those circumstances.",1,1

"Gay marriage is milestone that our society needs to achieve at every level and around the world, The fact that many individuals are suffering from lack of expressing their love openly and genuinleny should be a shame for this time and era. We should stand by the universal principle that states, love is love.",0,1
"We should have (as a country) a welcoming atmosphere for those who come from poorer part of the world, and for those who want to connect their business with the U.S. However, as any immigration laws or regulations, it is important to control the influx of individuals crossing out border and overstaying their visa.",1,1

"Everyone woman has the right to make her own informed decision about her own body without judgement. It should be illegal for anyone to take that right away from a woman in this country. It doesn't matter if a woman has been raped, made a mistake or just does not find herself fit to be a mother; the choice to end her pregnancy should be decided by her and her alone. It should not be up the government or any individual group of people or religion group because that decision does not affect anyone more than the woman carrying he fetus. We need to learn how to respect women and their bodies and whether than bring them down, support them.",1,1
"It's against the law to commit suicide and we should not allow anyone, no matter how much pain they may be in to have that option. We should be treating these people who are thinking about euthanasia with mental help and assistance to get them back to a healthier mind set. It goes against everything in the Bible to take your own life and you will not be going to Heaven, which shows you are not making the right choice. You should not have the power to make those decisions and trained doctors and hospital should not be assisting people in ending their lives, but they should focus on their main objective and helping those people. We need to make this illegal because people cannot think they have the power to just end things when they want. It's ridiculous and immoral that we would allow anyone to help someone else end their life especially since kids are dying of cancer and haven't lived. We cannot support murdering our own people!",0,0
"The bible says a relationship is between a man and a woman, not a woman and a woman or a man and a man. It's an abolishment for two of the same sex people to get married. It's shameful to this country and to our God to allow this to happen. It's not right for two men or two woman to be kissing or in any type of relationship together. It's not normal and this is a new trend that has been happening. The fact two women and two men cannot create babies should be another reason to convince people that it's not right or normal. If it was they would be able to make a baby naturally, but they cannot. Gay marriage needs to be illegal because it's teaching our kids that this immorality is okay and I do not accept it. It's disgusting and not right. It's a mental illness that needs to be treated with therapy and medication. They need to be put in the hospital to cure them of this disease. They do not deserve the same rights as real married people because it's not a real marriage. They are not mentally capable or in the right place to be making these decisions because our God tells us this is not love and this is not moral.",0,0
"This is a country full of people from all over the world, a melting pot is what they called it during school and we all came or at least our families did from somewhere. It's insane that we are going to even start to become stricter on migrants from other countries. It's even more crazy we want to build a wall to keep them out or stop them from coming to our country. This country was founded as a place for all people, all races, all religions and all colors, but now it's only for the superior and those superior are all the white powerful men that run this country. We should continue to allow all migrants to enter our country, documented or not documented because this is the land of free.",1,0
There is no reason why the legalization of cannabis should not be happening in all 50 states because this is not an addicting drug. This drug is legalized can bring in a lot of money taxed for the United States and it can also go to help a lot of people with medical issues. It has been proven to help reduce pain especially for those in cancer treatment and if monitored and used correctly this can be a great way of keeping people out of pain. It also allows our jail systems to be less full with people there on cannabis activity which is insane. The legalization will allow people to continue to use this drug in a legal and financially beneficial way for the USA.,1,1
"I am not in favor of abortion in most cases. This is a life that you are taking if you choose to terminate. If you are responsible enough to have sex, then you should be responsible enough to create a life and support it. Only in extreme cases of rape or severe health risks would I even consider abortion. Our major function as humans are to create life and I would never want to see that discarded. We should always focus our efforts on pro-life for all humans. There is a place in this world for everyone.",1,1
"The right to kill yourself should be legal. I don't think you need a government or doctor to tell you what to choose. You have the right to end your life at any time and there should be no consequences. This is just part of free will and the right to choose. If you have a terminal illness and see no hopes of recovering, this might be your only solution to being out of pain and agony. It should be legal in every state. It is a lot cheaper than trying to find a cure for a disease.",0,1
"Gay marriage is a great thing. I think you should be able to marry whoever you want to. If 2 men or 2 woman want to be together legally, marriage is the answer. Marriage is just a written contract that binds 2 people together in the eyes of the law. It is no different than forming a company partnership and should be treated as such. I am all for this right to be married in any compacity",0,0
I believe we are a nation of migrants and migration is a positive aspect when it is performed legally. I feel everyone should be able to go where they can find the best wages or living environment for themselves and their families. Legal migration is a must as we make a footprint on this earth and we need to be accountable for that through proper identification. Our country was founded on migration over the last several hundred years. I think its a win win proposition for all if its done legally and responsibly.,1,1
"I believe legal cannabis is good for many people to be able to enjoy the effects which is no different than alcohol. As long as it is regulated for safety in some form, it is a positive proposition. For those with chronic health pains, it is a very healthy alternative than to pain killers. I think it is much less addictive and controllable. As any drug though, consumer use responsibility is a big factor. I think people should be able to determine if cannabis is right for them and not the government.",1,1
"Abortion is absolutely wrong, it is fundamental that life begins at conception. The process of life is therefore the beginning of life. This right should be protected from those who would seek to capitalize on the political capitol of aiding low-income workers.",0,1
"You should absolutely have the right to die when you choose to. Just like you should have the right to proper medical care when you need it. You should be able to establish the terminus of your life based on your own set of parameters. Barring any critical mental deficiencies, there is absolutely no reason to keep people suffering in order to prolong life arbitrarily.",1,1
"I strongly support gay marriage. My belief is the same as that of the ""Rent is too damn high party"" that is: If you want to marry a shoe, I'll marry you. It seems to be insane, and somewhat counter productive to block people from sustained happiness on a systemic level. This would impede happiness and limit economic prosperity.",1,1
Migrants are the antithesis of what this country is about. By supporting migrants we inherently don't support our own people. You can only choose one. We have to support our own people to increase our prosperity. We have no control over who these migrants are and should absolutely not let these mysterious people into our country instead of supporting our own workers.,0,1
"Cannabis is a drug, therefore it should be illegal. People should be prevented from causing themselves harm and harm to other through the use of such illicit substances. Cannabis has strong psychoactive properties that induce effects that are impossible to control. It is a gateway to other addictions and sins. Let's not invest, as a culture, in sin.",0,0
Abortion should not be legal because it is taking the life of an innocent person. The baby cannot speak for themself so people need to fight against abortion to protect them. If women do not want to be a parent they should look into options such as not having sex and adoption if they become pregnant. There are lots of families that would like to adopt a baby.,0,1
"My opinion on euthanasia is that it should be allowed in some circumstances. I do not have a huge amount of knowledge on this topic, but I think Oregon allows euthanasia and their regulations seem to be well thought out. In my understanding there are restrictions such as the person needing to be of sound mind and have a terminal illness. I think with certain restrictions in place like these, physician assisted suicide allows people to be more comfortable.",1,1
"My opinion on gay marriage is that it should be allowed. Allowing gay marriage does not cause any detriments to someone who is not involved in the marriage. It also allows benefits to be allowed for same sex couples such as tax benefits, health insurance, and more stability for same sex couples' children. I really cannot think of a reason for same sex marriage not to be allowed.",1,1
Migrants should not be allowed into our country because they take the jobs of people in America who want to work. Migrants bring a lot of crime into our country. They are also a strain on the financial system because they do not pay taxes but they place demands on our welfare system.,0,1
"Cannabis should not be legal. It is a very dangerous and addictive drug. Millions of people are harmed by cannabis every year, especially after it is legalized in some areas. People involved in cannabis should be jailed or maybe killed.",0,1
"I don't believe abortion should be legal. A baby is alive, and abortion is the same as murder. Women should just put their children up for adoption if they don't want them. Anyone who has an abortion or performs an abortion should be held responsible for taking a life.",0,1
"I believe people should be able to end their own lives in certain situations. If someone is going to be in agonizing pain, or have low quality of life then they should be able to decide their future. Allowing euthanasia would also probably reduce healthcare costs. I think everyone should also have a resuscitation order at all times (whether they would want to be resuscitated or on life support).",1,1
"I think that gay people should be allowed to get married. Marriage is just a social construct. If people are in a committed relationship then they should be able to consider themselves married by law. I am not gay, but allowing gay people to marry has no affect on me or my marriage.",1,1
"I don't think we should allow migrants to enter the country except under extreme circumstances. If migrants do want to enter a country they should follow the proper procedure, no matter how long it takes. These people will probably just be a burden to society and cause crime rates to increase. We should do whatever it takes to keep migrants out.",0,1
I don't think cannabis should be legalized. The people who use cannabis are usually criminals anyway. Cannabis is also a gateway drug that leads to other drug use. If cannabis is legalized then what is stopping other drugs like heroin from being legalized?,0,1
Our population isnt growing right now so I think we should not abort so that our population rate can increase. Abortions should not be optional. If you dont want to have kids then take the precautions necessary to not get pregnant. There are way too many couples who are wanting a baby but cant make one so they rely on unwanted babies to be borned so they can adopt them. Abortions should definitely be illegal.,0,1
"No one deserves to be euthanized. Its the same like abortion. How would you like it if you were a happy little camper and all of a sudden someone who cant stand you says, kill him bc i said so. No, that is not okay with me. We should be more considerate about other living things and peoples feelings. It is cruel. The only time i think it is accepltable is when the animal is really really struggling and hurting then it is only right to let them rest in peace.",1,1
"I have been around way too many straight relationships where they live like hell, always fighting and cant stand each other but as a Christian I thought ""oh well, its life"" then i ran into gay married couples who seemed happy. Lately Ive been thinking, as long as they are happy, its all that really matters. We shouldn't limit ourselves to who cant or can love us. Id someone loves us as we are, what more can we ask for?",1,1
"I think we should welcome anybody with exceptions like no crime, here for a purpose or with family. Those types of deals. If we dont let migrants be, we can die and be attacked by them, it is very risky. Migrants are thieves, liars, deceivers and satan worshippers. Migrants are know to sneak in random peoples basements and camp out and eat their food and steal all of their belongings. This is my opinion on migrants.",0,1
Weed is a drug and it can kill us so please do not legalize it. Its kills people. People die every day from cannabis. Cannabis caused cancer and other deadly diseases. That is why the government doesn't want to legalize it everywhere. They are afraid that criminal rates will increase. Death rates from cannabis is skyrocket high. Getting high leads to mental disorders that are not easy to fix. They have to wing off of it. Please do not allow for this highly hated drug to be available to us. We would not appreciate that at all. Consider the humans.,0,0
"Abortion should be illegal in all cases. Life is sacred, and there are many laws that protect life outside the womb, so laws should also protect life inside the womb. The argument that the mother's health should supersede that of her child is insufficient. A person needing an organ transplant doesn't have the right to end the life of a potential donor, so abortion should be treated in the same way. Medical science is advancing to the point that abortion isn't needed to protect the life of pregnant women, and options like adoption exist after birth to help women who might not be financially able to care for a child.",0,1
"In very limited circumstances, Euthanasia should be legal. Patients who are terminally ill and experiencing poor quality of life (like severe pain, immobility, dementia or other mental ailments) should be able to have a conversation with their family and doctor about their end of life wishes. They should also speak to a trained mental health profession to determine that they are of sound mind when making their decision. An injection or prescription pill provided by the physician would be much more humane than the suicides many suffering patients are currently forced to choose for themselves. Euthanasia would prevent pain and suffering on the part of the patient and the family.",1,1
"Gay marriage should be legal. There are no credible legal arguments against gay marriage. The only arguments people seem to use against gay marriage are religious-based ideas, and these should not be considered in the context of a legal decision because of the separation of church and state. Gay marriage gives the same rights in regards to things like insurance, next-of-kin, and inheritance that straight couples enjoy.",1,1
"The United States needs to crack down on migrants coming from other countries, especially countries that don't share similar cultural values. The economy is already experiencing strain, and migrant workers who don't pay taxes but use social services continue to be a drain on resources that are already limited. The country should cut down on the number of legal immigrants it accepts every year, and should adopt a stricter stance on cultural beliefs required to immigrate. Illegal immigration should be curtailed with greater security at our borders and harsher punishments for those seeking to enter the country illegally.",0,1
"Marijuana in all forms should be illegal. Studies have shown that it can be detrimental to the human brain. Someone under the influence of cannabis might pose a danger when operating heavy machinery or driving a vehicle. Mind-altering substances of other kinds are prohibited because of their harmful effects, even though some of them were previously used for medicinal purposes. The possible health benefits of cannabis do not outweigh its potential danger to health and safety.",0,1
"Medical science can can conclusively prove heartbeats and infant movements at an extremely early stage in embryonic development. This proves that the infant is alive at conception, and abortion is murder. If I were to smash a bald eagle's egg I would be punished. Killing a baby in its mothers womb should be considered even more unthinkable.",0,1
"Human euthanasia is a controversial and complex topic. On one hand there is the argument that people who are terminal and suffering should have the right to end that suffering on their own terms. However the argument can also be made that some people in this position feel coerced by there caregivers, and don't truly wish to end their lives. I have never been in the position of having a loved one chronically suffering, so I do not feel qualified to objectivitly form an opinion.",1,1
"I am totally in favor of gay marriage. Being gay is a biological occurrence, and gay people have real feeling for each other. Gay couples are entitled to the same rights and protections as straight couples.",1,1
Many people in the United States are chronically un- or under-employed. However we are allowing people from foreign nations to come and take jobs from these people. Our country has a duty to protect our people before others. We must severely limit the amount of migrants allowed in to only those who provide essential skills.,0,1
"Marijuana is a gateway drug. Allowing it to become legal will lead to an increase in the use of other drugs. In addition smoking of tobacco is being increasingly regulated, so we should not be allowing any new forms of smoking. Marijuana is now and should remain illegal.",0,1

"A woman should NOT have the right to abortion because it is their baby's life they are taking and they should not be the only ones allowed to make decisions based on their bodies and what is best for their life because it also concerns the life of another being. Even if a woman is raped and gets pregnant, they should not be allowed to get an abortion.",0,1
"Euthanasia is something that is up to the person who is ill and suffering to decide, so their decision should be respected and their wish granted. Only they know the suffering they are going through personally, so it should be up to them to decide even if other people don't agree.",1,1
I think everyone has the right to marry whoever they want. So that includes people that are homosexual. They are people just like everyone else and deserve to marry whoever they want because they aren't hurting anyone else by doing so.,1,1
"I think the laws surrounding immigration need to be revised and forced differently. There's got to be a better way to identify who can come into the country and who simply can't. It is tricky to say that I agree 100% with immigrants because a lot of them are criminals, and a lot of them aren't. So I think a solution should be made based on who can come in and who can't.",0,1
"I think cannabis should be legalized, because like alcohol, it is up to the person to want to smoke or not. Cannabis can be used for other purposes besides recreational ones so I think legalizing it would be more beneficial than harmful.",0,1
"Abortion should be accepted as women have the right to choose over their bodies, especially in regard to pregnancy. The body of a growing human being will never be equal to the value of the woman carrying it. Allowing abortion is the safest choice for women to desire to stop their pregnancies.",0,1
It is tough to support the decision of ending life. I believe we have a certain time given on earth and we should not prolong or stop that time by artificial ways. It is best to let nature run its course and for the person/animal to die of natural causes.,1,1
I believe gay marriage is not a good choice because it goes against the principle of family and creates an imbalance in the parents' relationship. It also affects the kids' views with regard to gender roles. I believe that the dawn of humanity will be in great part due to gay marriages.,1,1
Immigration is one of the main safety issues affecting the country. An immediate immigration regulation should be in place and enforced. Immigration should from only certain countries should be permitted.,0,1
Cannabis should be allowed in all the country. Its medical and recreational benefits are clear and people should be able to access it without restraints. The most advanced countries in the world are now allowing the free use of Cannabis.,0,1
"I think abortion is absolutely fine, and in fact an extremely reasonable thing to do. Abortion is the woman's choice, as it is her body, and her health at risk carrying an unborn child. I firmly believe that women should be allowed to get an abortion if they so desire/need to have one, and I believe it should be allowed at any point during pregnancy so long as the mother's health is not afflicted.",1,1
"I think killing anyone is unethical, and a horrible manipulation of state power. Euthanasia robs humans of the one gift they are supposed to have innately; life. I believe it could be substituted for any number of things: life in prison, community service, rehab, reconditioning, etc.. We need to keep our people alive and forgive, if we can. That's the human way.",0,0
"Gay marriage shouldn't be allowed because the bible says so. It is explicit that man should lie with woman and not another man. Gay people have their own communities and can go be with other gay people, but the institution of marriage is an inherently religious one, and if the religion that commands the institution is explicitly against homosexuality, then it shouldn't condone it. Gay people can be life partners or in domestic partnerships, but marriage is reserved for those following the word of God.",0,1
"I believe a large part of the U.S. workforce is powered by our immigrants, and I believe that the people complaining about them are the exact same people who believe they are 'above' the kind of labor that immigrants perform. America is a nation of immigrants, and I believe that treating them like dirt, de-humanizing them and their work, is one of the most un-american things I can imagine. The wall? Absurd and one of the most half-baked ideas I've ever heard in my life.",1,1
"I think cannabis should absolutely be illegal. Cannabis is a drug, and it harms our youth and adult labor force in a multitude of ways. Cannabis use can lead to laziness, clouded judgement, impaired ability, and can even serve as a crutch to actually dealing with problems. While it may not be inherently addictive, it might become someone's go-to when they feel down or depressed or bad, and that crutch then easily becomes an addictive tendency. Even if there were no bad ties to the drug, it is still a drug, and I don't think the federal government should be promoting the sale or consumption of a drug.",0,1
"I think abortion should be legal everywhere, WORLD WIDE. A woman's body is her own and we have the right, AND FINAL, say about our bodies and what we do with them. What happens if a woman, or teenager for that matter, becomes pregnant because of a rape? What happens when a doctor tells a woman she is pregnant but her chances of both her and the dying are in the top 1%? A man is his body and women don't have a say and there are currently no laws telling men what they can do with their bodies, why should women be any different?",1,1
I think those that want to take their own lives are destined for eternal hell. Jesus does not forgive those who are willing to commit such a horrible act without thinking of others first. It is a selfish act and such a person who performs it should not be hoping to go to heaven. Eternal damnation is where they belong.,0,1
I think gay marriage should be banned and all gays set on fire. There is no place for them here and they are tainting our society with filth and trash. The bible says all kinds of blasphemy about gays and gay marriage. It is either a man marries or woman or nothing at all.,0,1
"The United States has been a melting pot for years. I don't think that the upper or middle class men would want the jobs migrant works currently hold. Those jobs are construction workers, janitors, garbage men and truthfully any job that is looked down upon. The same goes for upper or middle class women. Those jobs are alterations specialists, administrative work and the list goes on and on.",1,1
Cannabis is a drug. It is also a gateway drug that leads to other addictions. It is just a catalyst for the youth in our society today to start experimenting with other hardcore drugs. First it is weed and then pills and then heroin. It is a sad and slippery slope and many youth will die simply be dabbling with cannabis. It should forever remain illegal.,0,1

"I think marijuana should not only be legal, it should be permitted anywhere people are allowed to eat and drink.",0,1
"I believe we should each have the ultimate determination over our own bodies. We each have our own trials and challenges in life to deal with, no one else should determine our fate or our well-being. This is especially so when a pregnancy is the result of rape or abuse. Those who would sit in judgment of a woman's choice to terminate an unwanted pregnancy might try a more productive route such as helping to improve the lives of unwanted and homeless children.",1,1
"Euthanasia is wrong on so many levels. First it's against God's law to take our own lives, and that is precisely what this is even if one has to rely on a doctor or someone else to take the final action. Even in the case of illness, every moment of life is precious and should be savored. One never knows when a miracle will happen, so why give up and give in. Live!",0,0
We must not lose the traditional values that made this country great. Where will it all end if we give free reign to gays to marry and adopt children. We must stay strong and refuse to allow our values to erode by allowing gay marriage. Those who oppose this practice should be hailed as heroes.,0,0
"Contrary to what many on the right use in their arguments, few if any ""liberals"" are for open borders. We are however for human treatment of all people, but particularly those seeking asylum from abuse and persecution. There is a need for improved border security, however there are so many smarter ways to do this than to build a wall. We need better equipment, better systems, better training for our border staff and a path to citizenship. Children are being marked for life, life's are being broken all while the WH plays politics.",1,1
"There are those who insist that cannabis is not a gateway to harder drugs but I've seen precisely the opposite first hand. People I've known, friends who began smoking pot in nearly ever case went on to cocaine and other substances eventually. I know that there are no guarantees either way, but why make it easier? Some people are more inclined toward addictive behavior and we shouldn't make it harder for them.",0,1
"I am a Catholic and personally do not believe in abortion. I used to believe it was right to promote legislation making it more difficult to get an abortion, and instead provide better access to education and birth control. However, as a feminist, I have grown to believe I do not have a right to dictate what another woman does with her body.",1,1
"I believe that euthanasia should be a legalized option for anyone suffering from physical or mental illness. Having this option open would reduce the rates of suicides, which has spiraled to epidemic levels. It would also allow people to die with dignity and spare them and their families astronomical healthcare bills.",0,1
"I believe that no specific legislation should be made for gay marriage because I believe that the government should not be involved in marriages at all. There should be one path for people to get the legal rights currently assigned to marriage, such as property rights and power to make medical decisions. Leave marriage to the churches.",0,1
"I believe that migrants seek to come to this country for better economic and educational opportunities, and that often they are fleeing very unsafe conditions. I believe we should welcome migrants who have not participated in unlawful activities and help them integrate into American life through social services and English language classes (as needed). I also believe that migrants have a right to participate in and celebrate their own cultures and languages, and that sharing those experiences with the larger community is valuable.",1,1
I believe that cannabis should be legalized uniformly across the United States so that people can use it for medication as needed. Reducing dependency on big pharma can only be a good thing. IT would also prevent the legal stickiness for those people who live in legalized cannabis states but who work for the federal government or other jobs which prohibit use of marijuana.,0,1
My opinion on abortion is that it is wrong. That child if not killed could go on to live an amazing life somewhere else with someone else. The child could grow up to do great things like travel in space or discover the cure for cancer. It is not right to choose whether or not they get to enjoy the beauty of life.,1,1
Euthanasia is bad and would get abused by people who don't need it. They would use it to commit suicide and it is possible that they could regret it later but its too late.,0,1
gay marriage is wrong because it is a sin in gods eyes. But god is fake and does not exist so saying that then becomes a fake opinion based on a fake belief.,0,1
You must come to the country legally and fill out the necessary paperwork. It is the law and it is important to have citizenship and have a log on every citizen. It is the future now and we need to keep track of who is a citizen of the country. If you come illegal and break the law you should be arrested and shipped back immediately.,1,1
"Cannabis is the devils lettuce. Everyone who smokes it will become lazy, stupid, and it is harmful to their bodies and society.",0,1
Abortion is not a easy issue. There are some circumstances where it is plausible and others where it is cruel. The government should stay out of the decision and stop promoting and celebrating it as women's rights. Most people consider it a hard choice to make. It's not something to be glorified.,1,1
Killing terminally ill people who want to die is not murder. People give consent and a medical professional knows what is best for the patient. The medical professional should be allowed to end suffering. It's not up to the rest of society to make tough decisions. It's between a person and their doctor.,0,1
Gay marriage is needed in society. People have the right to do what they want and the government shouldn't say otherwise. It is difficult for the LBGT community to fit in. Our society should make them feel more part of our culture.,0,1
The policy on immigration needs change. Illegal immigrants should not be allowed leniency. It belittles all the legal immigrants that fight to be here. Our government should not tolerate breaking the law regardless of why.,1,1
Pot is less harmful than other drugs. Legalization is one of the least worries the government has on it's shoulders right now. Society has archaic thinking and they need to move into modern times. This is something that will eventually happen nationwide. Might as well do it sooner rather than later.,0,1
Abortion is completely wrong. I believe a child has a right to life without anyone making that decision for it. I believe abortion is wrong from contraception all the way up to right before birth. Only potential health issues can change my view.,1,1
I believe this shouldn't be allowed It's assisted murder Taking a life is wrong regardless of the situation murder is wrong.,0,0
I hate gay marriage. It is unnatural. It is disgusting. Only a man and a woman should marry.,0,0
Migrants should follow the proper way to become a citizen. Otherwise they are damaging our country by entering illegally. Im not racist. I just want them to enter by the book.,1,1
Completely wrong. Puts holes in brain. Drugs make us dumb. Cannabis is a drug that damages us and makes us lazy.,0,0
"I consider abortion as killing a human. Especially, if the baby has no serious health issues, I am opposed to the idea of abortion. I don't think that abortion is an individual preference. Killing an unborn baby by abortion is the same as killing someone else.",1,1
"Let them die, if they don't wanna live anymore. Life is an opportunity for humans. If someone does not want to take this unique opportunity, let them die.",0,0
"If someone feels gay, let him/her/whatever live how they want. Every individual has the right to live their own life by their personal choices. No one should be directing others how to live.",0,1
"I am generally positive towards migrants. Every individual has the right to live a better life. To me, no one owns a country. Most countries have people from various ethnic origins. As long as migrants seek a better life and intend to contribute to society they should not be denied. However, there is a need for better regulations for migrants.",1,1
"Cannabis should be definitely legal. People already taking cannabis, if they want it. Some bad people already making money through the illegal sale of cannabis. Let it be legal and prevent bad people making money over cannabis lovers.",0,1
"I believe that abortion should not be completely illegal because it will cause greater harm to others, but that it should be extremely limited to very early fetuses in the gestational age. Abortions after about 8 weeks should be eliminated, except in cases of severe harm to the fetus. I agree that women need the choice, but that abortion is used as contraception too much and it causes real pain to men and women who have chosen to abort. I think the consequences on the mother's psyche are not discussed enough and that lawmakers have become evil allowing abortions up to birth, since that is murder.",1,1
"I think euthanasia should be illegal because people should not be allowed to decide they want to die. Suicide is against the law, and those who assist them should be punished. Someone who is diagnosed with a deadly disease should not have the option to check out early. It is against God's law and they will spend eternity in Hell.",0,0
"I think that gay marriage should be banned because in the Bible, God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of homosexual activities. The Bible believes men and women should be together and not people of the same sex. When same sex couples marry, it lowers the morality level of society and gives children a bad example. I think only heterosexuals should be allowed to marry and procreate.",0,1
"I believe that too many people are not following the correct path to become citizens and too many are coming into America illegally. Although I value all human rights and I understand their countries are violent and some are trying to better their lives, American policy should be make it a little easier for migrants to come here. However, we also have to take care of the homeless, Veterans and children before giving illegal immigrants the funds. It is hard for me to be firm like this, but I think too many people are working for cash, not paying taxes like citizens do, and taking away jobs from Americans, who need the money to provide for their families.",1,1
"Marijuana should not be legal because it is the Gateway drug and causes people to become users of more illicit drugs. Allowing marijuana to be legal will result in many more crimes, car accidents, and the like, and it will be taxed to the maximum so all the money goes to government. Marijuana will result in a loss of morality in society.",0,1
"I am firmly against elective abortion. The Roe Vs. Wade decision was an abomination. Legalizing murder as a form of post-conceptive birth control was atrocious. When I hear women proclaiming that it's their body, their right, I want to gag, because, NO, it's NOT their body, it's their baby's body, and choosing to kill it is not their right.",1,1
"Doctors and nurses should always have the right decide to end a patient's life at the patient's request. They are medical practitioners after all and they know best, and have better judgment on the matter than the rest of society.",0,1
Gay marriage completely destroys the foundations of family. It is an abomination that can only be tolerated by the morally depraved.,0,0
"We do need better border control. Although I think that Trump's idea about a wall is idiotic, the idea of totally open borders is even more idiotic. Citizens of our closest allies, i.e. Canada and Britain have to jump through hoops for years to get into this country legally. It's a slap in their face to look aside when people cross our borders illegally. The thing that irritates me the most about the immigration issue, is that the same people that advocate open borders are the same people that yell about domestic poverty and lack of opportunity. Apparently they think the best way to put out a fire is to throw gasoline on it.",1,1
"Marijuana is the root of all evil.. Even the legalization of cannabis for medicinal purposes was a crock. To legalize it for recreational use would be one more step in lowering the morality of the nation. Everyone knows that marijuana is a gateway drug to crack, heroine, and methamphetamines.",0,1
"I believe it should be legal for the first 2 trimesters and allowed in extreme cases for 3rd trimester. Personally, I would try to dissuade a girlfriend from getting one, but would also help her if she decided to. If it was a close friend, I would think twice about butting in. But I definitely don't feel that I should have any influence over someone else. And, any religious position should have no influence because we're not ruled by religion.",1,1
Allowing euthanasia might seem reasonable but that's only the first step. The next think you know people will be executing you once you turn 60! And what if the doctors that thought there was no hope were wrong? Nobody should decide when you die except God.,0,1
"If we allow gay marriage than all our kids are going to think it's okay to be heathen's. It's disgusting and unnatural. Plus, they can always get a civil union. Why isn't that good enough for them?",0,1
"I've got no problems with migrants. I've worked with people from other countries and had a foreign roommate in college. I just don't see the big deal. Even the low, educated manual workers seem nice to me. 100 years ago my relatives arrived from Italy. I think they would want any migrants to have an easier time than they did.",1,1
"Oh, what a great idea. We don't have a big enough problem with drunk driving so we're going to allow driving while high on pot. The only people who smoke pot are degenerates. They should be jailed.",0,1
"I think abortion is wrong. However, I personally have never been in the position that I had to choose whether it was an option or not. I do feel that certain circumstances could justify this action for other people (such as pregnancy due to a rape). But I also think that adoption is the best route to go. The only issue with this is that the adoption process is very expensive and time-consuming, and therefore creates a disinterest in allowing a child to be at risk for ending up in foster care/orphanage from not being adopted. My significant other spent much of his childhood in an orphanage, and this has altered his mental stability dramatically when it comes to self-acceptance, trust, and love. Not only are these issues, but because he never had a real mother, he tends to cling to me as a motherly figure in certain situations, and this is unhealthy for our relationship.",1,1
Euthanasia should not be allowed under any circumstance. No one should be allowed to choose another beings outcome based on the amount of pain they are in because they think that is what is right.,0,0
Gay marriage is wrong. People who believe they are gay have a severe mental condition. It is disgusting to think about how a relationship between the same sex could be acceptable.,0,1
"I don't see an issue with allowing immigrants to enter our country, but there needs to be a very rigorous security investigation before allowing this. I also think that before allowing immigrants to come in, the American government needs to take care of the citizens we already have and stop wasting trillions of dollars on things that are a waste (professional athletes and lotteries for example). Our economy would recover well if this was addressed and would allow for a smoother transition into allowing immigrants to become citizens.",1,1
I don't think cannabis legalization is a good idea. Pharmaceutical companies and healthcare systems would suffer dramatically from this legalization.,0,1
Abortion is on peoples minds more than ever lately.  I have mixed feelings about abortion.  I had an abortion as a younger person. I find myself thinking about it often and it upsets me. If abortion had been illegal I would not have had that option in such an emotional time. I wish abortion had been illegal so I did not have the choice at that time. I hope God understands and forgives me. I think about the life I aborted and sometimes feel their presence. I believe my child forgave me. I wish I had my child today. I am crying now.,1,1
People should have to suffer instead of being let go with assistance. Suffering is funny to me. Doctors who help people pass away should be punished. People are supposed to feel pain.,0,1
I think everyone should be gay. Being gay is the right way to live. Gay people should get special treatment. God likes it when people are gay.,0,0
I am against anybody coming to our country illegally. I have personally known people who have had to work very hard to become a legal citizen. I do not respect people who break the law and come here the wrong way. I do not believe anyone breaking into our country should have services of any kind provided to them.,1,1
Legalizing cannabis will make everyone start doing other drugs. People who smoke pot are dangerous. Weed is natural but it is still addictive. I hate cannabis.,0,1
"I feel that abortion is morally reprehensible, but from a pragmatic standpoint, I can understand it to some degree. For instance if a woman is raped, I don't think she would be necessarily immoral if she had an abortion, though I still wouldn't really like it. I can also entertain the argument that a child born to a mother who doesn't want the child or the mother or parents are, for instance, hard drug addicts, I could see why maybe the baby would be better off not having to grow up in that environment, but I still think it's better to give the baby a chance or give it up for adoption. My main issue with abortion is with late-term abortions and the fact that $500 million/year of taxpayer money funds Planned Parenthood and they donate $30 million/year to political candidates and campaigns.",1,1
"I think euthanasia is acceptable in some circumstances. For instance, if a group of people have the plague, it might be better to euthanize them for the greater good of society. Or if there is a group of people who are warmongerers it might be better to euthanize them for the good of society as a whole.",0,1
"I believe gay marriage should be illegal because two men or two women cannot produce a child and therefore their relationship shouldn't be classified as marriage. We need children to be born in order to perpetuate the human race and it takes a man and woman to produce a child. In my opinion, a civil union between gay people would be okay, but I don't think they should get the tax breaks that a heterosexual married couple gets. It also goes against the teachings of the Bible and the Koran.",0,1
"I feel that the migration policy in the US is broken and needs to be fixed. We used to have merit-based immigration, where we accepted people based on whether they would benefit our society, but now we just let anybody in and we don't do a good job of enforcing the laws that we have on the books. Illegal immigration costs American taxpayers over $1 billion/year and over 70% of Hispanic-led immigrant households are on at least one form of welfare and Mexicans make up the most immigrants in 32 of the 50 US states.",1,1
"I think cannabis is the devil's weed. It is a gateway drug that can lead users to use other hard drugs. It causes people to become lazy and sit at home all day playing video games, eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew all day. People who smoke week are all dirty hippies who smell like patchouli oil and don't wash their hair. If cannabis was legalized everyone would start to do it and it would be terrible for society. Think of the children!!!",0,0
"I believe in women's rights to have an abortion. It is the business of the woman whose uterus holds said fetus. Legal abortion helps to ensure that women are safe during these medical procedures. Without legal abortion, many women's lives are in danger.",1,1
"Euthanasia is wrong. No one should be playing God except for God himself. When it is their time, God will bring them home. It is inexcusable to take away another person's life, consent or not.",0,0
"I don't believe gay people should be allowed to be married. The sanctity of marriage, in God's eyes, is one man and one woman. We must stick to our core beliefs. The bible explicitly condemns homoerotic behavior.",0,1
"I think the wall is a ridiculous solution and waste of money. Our country was built on immigrants. Without these immigrants, we wouldn't be the melting pot that we are today. Immigrants are an integral part of our culture as a nation.",1,1
Marijuana should not be legalized. It is a gateway drug. People start with weed and go on to other hard drugs. This is why there is such an opioid problem today.,0,1
"My Body, my choice. i should have the ability to have a say if i can carry out a pregnancy or if i can deal with a unhealthy child especially in the USA. in a country that tells you you have to deal with everything on your own, the choice of bringing a child into this world should also be my own, considering it can actually bancrupt me. it should be available for everyone! ergo i am pro choice.",1,1
"well it seems a more peaceful option then doing a suicide on their own. i think we should be able to have a say if we want to live in this world or not. i mean it would at least reduce suiced by gun deaths, right.",0,1
i hate it so much. its totally unnatural. ever heard of the good old bible? well it tells you right there a man and a women are the foundation of a family. how did we even came to this? it should be forbidden and outlawed.,0,0
"i dont have a problem with migrants per se, what i do have a problem with is that they seem to not have the ability to understand that they are in an other country with different norms and values. so i feel we should give them protection i also think we should do our best to return them when it is safe. if they want to stay i would want them to learn how to live with the norms and values of their new country.",1,1
"This country already has a drugproblem, how can you make it worse? by legalizing cannabis! i mean it is a gateway drug, it will be same as with alcohol and nicotine. it will be easy for the underaged to get access to it and you cant tell me otherwise. and then what, have a 14 year old smoke a blunt just to be on other drugs 2 years down the line and overdosing by the age of 18? terrible idea.",0,0
