Abortion is so terrible! I don't understand why anyone would be able to go through with it! It is essentially just like killing someone!,0,1
"If someone was suffering and wanted to die, they should be able to die. There is no reason why people should be forced to live if they do not wish to due to a good reason, such as suffering from a medical problem. If life is not pleasant anymore due to an illness, a person should have the right to die.",1,1
"Gay Marriage is okay. I am not against it, and I don't really care. It does not really apply to me, so it doesn't really matter to me. I don't get why some people get so heated over this topic.",1,1
Migrants are taking all of our jobs! We do not need people coming from other countries to take our stuff and land! We need stricter enforcements!,0,1
"People smoke weed all the time, and the war on drugs is proven to be costly. Cannabis should just be legalized everywhere, since it is already legalized in many states. Even in states where it is illegal, people have easy access to it.",1,1
Abortion is killing. Abortion is killing at all levels of a baby develop in his mother's womb. They should arrest all abortion doctors in place them in jail. I can't believe the majority of our country is okay with abortions. We should stop all abortions now.,0,0
"I am not for Euthanasia. I believe people should be made conformable when they are dying. It should always be legal to practice Euthanasia. People should do time in prison who assist in helping others to die. I am very much against Euthanasia,",1,0
They have the right marry. I feel we should make Gay Marriage legal in every state. Gay married should be looked like regular marriages. People need to change their open about not allowing gay people to marry. Marriage should be seen between two people no matter if they are the same sex or not.,1,1
They need to send all of them back home. Stop using our resources for migrant. Migrants are all criminals .We should lock them up and place them in jails near our boarders. Migrants just want to use the USA.,0,0
It is a good thing to legalize cannabis. All states should legalize cannabis. I like that most states are making cannabis legal. It is very good most legal cannabis is used for health reason. However cannabis need to be used for social reason too.,1,1
"Abortion is the termination of a life and should not be allowed. If a fetus has made it to the point of being able to survive ""on its own"" outside its mother's body, what right do we have to cut its life short. If the mother's life is in danger, she already chose that she was willing to sacrifice her life to have a child when she consented to procreating.",0,1
"If a human adult has lived their life to the extent that they deem necessary and are ready for the end, I have no problem with there being an assisted ""suicide"" for their peace. If society has deemed an individual no longer worth our resources, but that person is still capable of taking care of themselves, I do not see us as having a right to decide for them that they need to be ""put down"".",1,1
"I believe, as adults, we love who we love. If they love us back, there should be no governmental body stopping their union in marriage. If the term ""marriage"" is defined as one man and one woman, let us come up with a new term to mean the legal union of two consenting adults.",1,1
"If people want to come to this messed up country, they should have to learn the hard way that everything here is legal tape and waiting in lines. They should not be allowed across any boarded without the proper approvals and paperwork in place first.",0,1
"Although I am against smoking and general drug use, in the hands of responsible adults, I do not have an issue with legalized cannabis consumption. I would want the same rules to apply as with smoking where public places and smoking within so many feet of a door are still upheld. Just because you are given a right to smoke does not mean I should have to be subjected to your second hand smoke.",1,1
"Abortion is a disgusting practice that should be illegal worldwide, due to the fact that it is taking a human life. Many may argue that life begins at certain points during a pregnancy, however morally life begins at inception. At the moment of inception, the two individuals have made a decision to create a life, and that decision should not be reversible. It is unfair to the unborn child, and furthermore is extremely damaging the body of the mother. It is essentially murder, and should be treated as such in the court of law.",0,1
"I personally believe that euthanasia should be legal under certain circumstances. If an individual is suffering from an incurable disease and is in tremendous amounts of agony, the option of euthanasia should be provided. If the patient is conscious and able minded, they should be able to make that decision themselves. However, in circumstances where the patient is not able minded, the most immediate relative should be allowed to make that decision, whether it be the spouse, parental, or child.",1,1
"To me gay marriage should be completely accepted in our society. Many would argue that the bible states that love is between a man and a woman, however, we do not live in a religious nation, and many other nation also allow freedom of religion. Being gay and marrying to the same sex is not immoral, nor does it in any way affect anyone else. I would argue that an individual does not choose who they are attracted to, rather it is an innate feeling. The fact that many oppose gay marriage is in direct contradiction with personal liberties instilled in our national documents.",1,1
"Migrants are what have made many countries, such as the United States, incredible. However, there comes a point where migrants pose an issue to national security, as well as burdening the economy. When migrants legally immigrate, they are allowed to become productive, contributing members of our society. Illegal immigration has lead to many deaths, as well as the influx of illegal drugs into our country. Furthermore, illegal immigrants burden our economy, by abusing our social systems while not paying for them in the form of taxes.",0,1
"Cannabis should absolutely be legalized, as much research has been done on the drug. Though it does cause the individual to be under the influence and unable to complete many tasks, it is much safer than some well known legal drugs such as nicotine and alcohol. Furthermore, cannabis has been shown to help individuals with a wide range of conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, panic attacks, ADHD, so on and so forth. In my personal opinion, individuals should be able to use drugs as they please at their own risk, and regulating them is a violation of personal liberties.",1,1
Abortion is murder. It is against God's plan. You are killing a human being and that is wrong. The baby suffers.,0,0
I am in favor of euthanasia for people who are suffering from a terrible illness. Although personally I do not think I would ever be ok with killing myself. I hope I am never put into such a terrible illness to where I feel I rather kill myself than continuing suffering. I think that is a very personal choice and should be left up to the effected person only.,1,1
"I am all for gay marriage. I think and strongly believe that two consenting adults should be allowed to marry whomever they love. No one should tell someone else how to live their life. No one should push their religious agenda onto others, because this country was based on religious freedom. Therefor someone's religious ideas have no place in someone else's life that does not ask for it.",1,1
"Migrants are a huge hurdle in this country. So many break laws. They just want a free ride in this country because they are lazy. Plus they all play loud music and have loud parties, and make the neighborhood look bad with their trashy cars and ten cars sitting everywhere. They never want to learn english. They expect me to learn theirs. They want to change the laws in this country and make it bad. We need stricter laws to keep these people out.",0,1
"I am behind legalizing cannabis. The reason is that it has many medical advantages. It helps so many people deal with their illnesses, whether they are physical or mental. Also it does not damage people like alcohol, yet alcohol is perfectly legal. I myself have ever never came across rowdy and stupid stoners, but many drunk obnoxious people have crossed my path in life.",1,1
"I do not believe that abortion should be legal unless the person was a victim of rape or is put at risk to carry a baby full term. With birth control, male and female condoms, and a morning after pill, there are little to no excuses. The act of sex is an adult decision. Like all decisions, they have consequences. It is your job to think ahead and play it safely. Females that go looking to have unprotected sex definitely should not have access to such things because then what are they learning? Nothing. Killing innocent life for your lack of responsibility seems childish. There are people in the world that can not have kids. They would gladly adopt.",0,1
"I think that if they suffering, there is nothing wrong with doing so. Once they are beyond saving, and they start to feel like they cant fight anymore, there should be an option like this. No one deserves to suffer until their day comes. Its humane. I feel that if you feel that they can't continue on without constant suffering, it is the best option. Honestly, would you want to suffer every waking moment until death?",1,1
"I fully believe that gay marriage deserves to be supported. Happiness can be scarce in this world and we shouldn't stand in the way of what makes someone truly happy. No one is getting harmed so why does anyone have a right to put their two cents in? A relationship between two people, same sex or not, is no one else's business. It is a relationship between those two and those two only.",1,1
"I think they should all be welcomed wherever. Provided they are not of ill intent, what are they hurting? They want to fit in just like the rest of us. They want to live free and happy. Is that so wrong? Its not like they lie awake plotting at night to do anything malicious, right? If you lived in a place where things were miserable and you were barely getting by, would you want to stay there? Is it fair to expect anyone else to?",0,1
"I honestly have no opinion either way. There are scientific studies that prove benefits of Cannabis. I believe that there should be restrictions, like alcohol, on age and when it is appropriate to use Cannabis. However, in the comfort of your home, I see it no different as having a cold one with a friend. I do not use any substance but I am open minded to this specific topic. I would never try it, but I also am not against those that do.",1,1
It is wonderful. A woman should have total control over her body. She should decide what grows it her body. I feel that it is a great thing because it allows women to have sex with whoever they want to and have total control over their reproductive lives without consulting anyone else. Women deserve to have absolute freedom to do whatever they want to sexually.,0,1
I think it is terrible in the extreme. It is a sin to kill and it is unworthy of a civilized people. I think that it cheapens life and is a mockery to all people of good will. I find it a loathsome hateful activity and it must be abolished. I would hope to see it end very soon.,1,1
"I find the idea of gay marriage or same sex marriage morally repugnant. It is a gross deviant lifestyle made up of at best confused ignorant and foolish individuals and at worst vile,loathsome dregs who are morally bankrupt,mentally deranged and physically enfeebled. It is a sin against God and a crime against their fellow man to hold such viewpoints. Their lifestyle is an abomination and a blight against humanity and all moral guidelines. I hate the idea of this horrible institution...Gay marriage.",1,1
I think that immigrants should be stopped at the border with a wall and those that are here illegally should be deported so that the world knows and respects our laws. The only way to deal with them is with a firm hand and harsh measures. I think we need to be very tough and deport as many as we can to send a powerful message to any future people that want to ignore our laws .,0,1
"I find that it is a terrible perversion. I would like to see the laws rolled back. It will weaken human beings : physically,morally and socially. Already we have too many people using drugs this will just make it worse. It was a terrible idea to begin with and the longer it lasts the worse it will be.",1,1
Abortion is bad for everyone. A fetus has rights and should never be killed. Abortion is outlawed even in the case of incest and rape. Abortion is harmful to everyone in society.,0,0
Euthanasia should be legal as long as the person is of sound mind. I think people live as they freely want and should die as they want. I think having people suffer for no good reason and not being able to end it is cruel and unusual . I hope one day euthanasia with certain guidelines will be allowed in society.,1,1
I think gay marriage is fine and should be legalized. Gone are the old traditional ways of thinking. Promoting gay marriage makes sense and I think is the only solution and could promote more equality. Too many people stigmatize what they don't understand.,1,1
Migrants are a blight on society. They do nothing good for society and just spread terror and crime. Migrants should go back to there home country. All migrants do is spread gangs and commit murders.,0,1
I think cannabis should be legal. It has shown to improve positive effects on people. It will bolster taxes and the economy. I think it has hidden medicinal traits to be used.,1,1
"A woman has no right to decide whether or not to keep the child inside her. That is killing a life. The woman was irresponsible enough for getting knocked up, now she has to suffer the consequences.",0,1
"I support this. The population is so high, that if people are suffering it makes sense to make their lives easier by ending them. It helps overpopulation, and at that suffering point, to be honest those people aren't of use anymore. It sounds mean but they are more of a burden than help.",1,1
"If a woman can marry a man, a man can marry a man. It doesn't affect anybody else, and people can do what they want. People think it's unnatural, but what is unnatural is their closeminded opinion. Love is love.",1,0
"Immigrants ruin our country. They take our resources and commit crime in return. They're useless, and we don't need them.",0,0
"Weed is amazing, it destresses people. But I can also see how badly it affects people's brainpower. It slows people down and makes them dumber. So I think it should be legalized, but with significant advertising on how slow it makes people.",1,1
"Abortion is murder, plain and simple. God said, ""Thou shalt not kill."" Those who commit murder deserve punishment, not the legal right to commit a crime. Abortion is evil and should not be condoned by the immoral minority or government.",0,0
"Euthanasia is often kinder than to allow a person to persist in a state of agony. No one can truly understand suffering unless it has been experienced firsthand. An individual should have the right to choose to die with dignity, to die without lingering in misery. No government should have the right to tell a person the value of his/her life.",1,1
"The term gay marriage should not even exist. Marriage should be the legal union of two people no matter their gender. The moral standards of the religious right is the only reason gay marriage is a social issue. Since there is no place for religion in our political system, this should be considered a moot point. All citizens should have the same rights regardless of their sex to marry, adopt children, and any other legal matter.",1,1
"This is the land of opportunity and should be open to all who want to better themselves. Their tax dollars will surely be sufficient to cover the additional services the government will have to provide. We will create new jobs for these people so everyone will have the opportunity to better themselves. We should never be willing to turn away people who are suffering due to their current quality of life. This is the USA after all, where hard work is the only thing that matters.",0,1
"Personally, I think all drugs should be legal and taxed. People who are using are going to do so no matter what laws command. I see no reason to lose out on the opportunity to generate a substantial amount of tax dollars. I see no difference between the use of alcohol and drugs.",1,1
Abortion should be against the law under all circumstances. Women should not have the right to make her own decisions about her body. There are no logical reasons to abort a fetus. I am completely pro life.,0,1
"Euthanasia should be legal for end of life patients. Watching a terminal patient suffer is terrible. If a person makes this decision, and is of sound mind, then it should be allowed.",1,1
Gay marriage should be legal. There should not be a gender distinction when discussing the legality of marriage. All people should be able to marry whoever they want.,1,1
Migrants should be prosecuted and deported swiftly. There need to be much stricter laws on migrant workers. i am a xenophobe and think that migrants are taking jobs from Americans. We would be better with a big wall to keep all migrants out.,0,1
"Cannabis should be legal medicinally and recreationally in all states. This will be profitable for the states, and for the government in general. People will be happy too. There really are no downsides to legalizing cannabis.",1,1
"As soon as a man and a woman create an zygote, they have created a responsibility for the fate of that creation. They can't just pretend that never happened. It may only be a few cells, but it is impossible to determine when a person's individuality becomes valuable and unique. Since you can't tell me when that zygote becomes an individual worthy of societies respect, I don't think you can tell me that anyone has the right to kill it.",0,1
"I find the idea of suicide horrible, but nobody should be able to determine for someone else what an acceptable amount of pain is. One way of loving someone is letting them go, and nobody should be able to tell someone else that their time isn't up of their life is horrible. I believe Euthanasia should be a carefully regulated right.",1,1
"Gay Marriage should not be even questioned. Everyone should be equal before the law and the Oberfell and Hodges case was clearly justly settled. Marriage isn't just about love, it is about ordering your life and passing on property. Depriving anyone of it's legal benefits is inhumane.",1,1
There are many people who wait in line like they are supposed to in order to get into this country and work. Letting other people skip the line only incentives rule breaking. We should send as many illegal migrants back to their home countries as we can. We have enough to worry about with the future automation crisis without wondering if we can take on more workers. Our wages have only just begun to grow again after 9 years of economic growth.,0,1
Cannabis should be legalized asap. As long as it is illegal good people will suffer for a victimless crime. Drug related crimes and criminal networks will both decline as a result. I also want the government to receive tax revenue from its sale.,1,1
"I believe that abortion is always wrong. There is no circumstance where abortion should be considered by a pregnant woman in our society today. That is a life in there that the mother is murdering when she chooses abortion- a life that could and should easily be adopted in our modern world. Plus, it as a disgrace to God. Women who chose abortion are baby killers.",0,1
"Euthanasia of people is wrong unless there are some really dire circumstances. If someone is brain dead, I believe that it could be a feasible option. I do not believe that depression or any mental illness is an excuse of euthanasia of any kind. I believe there are ways to solve those problem and our society would suffer if that became any kind of norm. I also do not believe in the euthanasia of babies as a sort of very late stage abortion.",1,1
"Gay marriage is totally fine in my book. I think that if two people want to get married, their sex shouldn't stop them. I do think that gay marriage gets a bit too much attention for something that is relatively insignificant. That being said, I understand it's a hot topic and only newly legal.",1,1
"I believe that we should let migrants in without any sort of screening as to whether or not they would benefit from entering our society. It is racist to say that they are only coming to benefit from the United State's excellent social services. Places like Canada need to allow more migrants, their policies are way to strict and qualifying people based on their potential contributions to society is dehumanizing. Any person should be able to enter the USA at any time with little to no discretion. They should also be granted citizenship on entry.",0,1
"Legalize weed! I think that there is no reason for weed to be illegal if alcohol is legal. The affects of weed are far less destructive than alcohol. Another plus is that we could collect tax money on weed sales. Another plus is that there would be far less people in prison for selling. The quality of weed would also go up as the FDA began regulating it, therefore making it safer to use.",1,1
"Abortion should never be an option, no matter what the situation is.  Abortion is murder. Unborn children should not be killed because of the choices of the parent. Even in the instance of rape, it is not OK to end the child's life.",0,0
Euthanasia should be legal everywhere.  You should be able to choose when you end your life. The popular stigma of the death of humans is unfair to individuals who do not share the same outlook on life. Euthanasia is an acceptable way to treat a painful terminal illness.,1,1
"I think that anyone should be able to get married, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Gay marriage should be legal everywhere and in any situation where heterosexual marriage is legal.  Gay married couples should receive the same benefits that heterosexual couples receive.  Gay married couples should be able to adopt children as easily as heterosexual couples.",1,1
Migrants should be highly limited to only those with legitimate skills that will benefit the country.  We should build a wall to reduce illegal immigration. Migrants take away jobs from current citizens.  Migrants pose a threat to current citizens lives by bringing danger to our people.,0,1
Cannabis should be decriminalized completely. More research should be conducted on the health benefits of cannabis. There is great opportunity for many different uses of the cannabis plant outside of medical and recreational use. Cannabis should be on the same level as alcohol legally.,1,1
i do not believe in abortion. abortion is murder. doctors who perform abortions are criminals. they should be put in jail for life.,0,0
"i believe in euthanasia. people have the right to die. if someone feels that their life is no longer worth living, then i think it's ok for a professional to assist them. this is how i truly feel.",1,1
"I have no objections to gay marriages. i believe people should be able to marry who they want. this is not the opinion i had when i was younger. fortunately as i have matured, so has my attitude.",1,1
i do not like migrants. all migrants are gypsies. migrants are criminals. migrants are dirty. migrants do not belong in this country.,0,0
"i believe that cannabis should be legal. currently legalization has occurred in some of the states. all 50 states should legalize it. not only for medical usage, but also recreational. it is no more harmful than alcohol.",1,1
"There is nothing particularly valuable about any given human life. Even if you say that each person is unique and unrepeatable, so are any of the flowers of the garden. This fact alone does not prevent anyone from cutting one down for any purpose. Humanity itself is nothing special, it is just that we seem to be the most intelligent inhabitants of Earth. If we found aliens elsewhere, we would have no affinity or reason to respect them, and they would have no reason to respect us. The respect we place on each other is entirely subjective. So, with abortion, we do not violate anyone's rights when we act in a way that may kill them. It is best that a baby die without the burden of conscious suffering rather than live a life of poverty and despair.",0,1
"The idea of ""death with dignity"" is an attractive one, but ultimately it falls flat. If I do not choose to hasten my own death, am I less dignified? Have I become less human? By promoting euthanasia, we tell people that your dignity only follows you utility, which induces despair beyond what is reasonable for someone in a declining situation to handle. Further, the option puts doctors at risk of conflicted priorities. By giving them the power and incentive to end a life, they are no longer solely focused on maintaining and promoting life and well-being. Our culture's promotion of euthanasia is a symptom of us not believing that all lives, at all stages, have inherent dignity.",1,1
"""Gay Marriage"" is a contradiction of terms. While I axiomatically do not support any unjust discrimination of anyone based on their sexual attractions, this issue is not about such discrimination. The fundamental human relationship and the supports that society gives to protect it are at stake here. Marriage is meant to keep parents together to best serve and educate the children that naturally result from their union. By creating ""gay marriage"" we are breaking down what is meant by marriage, which is a fundamentally different type of relationship. Conflating the two cheapens and guts our societal understanding of what marriage is. This issue has real consequences that will be felt for generations.",1,1
"The human spirit is an amazing thing. No one should be forced to stay in a place where they feel impeded or prosecuted. As such, everyone should be able to emigrate to whatever new home they wish to make for themselves. The concept of borders and fences is outdated and an artifact of wars and battle lines. To say otherwise is merely racist and amerio-centrist. We need to be more welcoming and we need to emigrate more as a people, even to countries in better need of our values and outlook on life. This is a solemn duty for us to fulfill as a people. We can do it.",0,1
"It would seem that the war on drugs has been an expensive exercise in futility. However, a reversal of position with regards to cannabis legalization send the message that voluntarily detaching yourself from reality, even for short periods of time, it a good thing. Our immense human capacity for love and creativity are stifled by the influence of drugs like cannabis, not helped by it. Any culture that promotes such a break with reality is leading itself to further mental illness. Cannabis is a step toward harder drugs which promote, along the same lines, a break with reality and with society. It isolates people and sets them at a disadvantage academically, professionally, and personally. We should not take steps to promote such things.",1,1
"Abortions are a sin and should be criminally punished. Women who choose to abort are muderers and should be put in jail. Women have many other options like adoption, so there is no need for abortions. These people have no morals and it is their own fault they are pregnant so they need to take responsibility.",0,0
Human euthanasia should be considered only when medically necessary and with the consent of the patient in a lucid state. Genetic conditions as well as accidents can leave people in pain and in suffering. Euthanasia should be considered only with physical pain or in elderly who are ill. Terminally ill patients should be able to have this option.,1,1
"Gay marriage should be legal in the United States. Marriage is a binding legal contract between two people, a persons belief should not interfere with other peoples ability to live their life the way they choose. Everyone should be ale to live their life how they choose. I support gay marriage since gay couples should have the same opportunities straight couples have.",1,1
"Immigrants are coming into our country and taking our jobs. There should be more boarder protection to stop immigrants from comping to the US. Immigrants should all be deported along with any children they had in the US. Americans pay taxes and the immigrants use up all the welfare and benefits, with out paying taxes.",0,1
The economy would benefit from legalization of cannabis. Cannabis has been shone to treat a number of ailments. The criminalization of cannabis targets low income residents as well as minorities. Cannabis legalization also helps reduce the intake of illegal drugs.,1,1
"I believe in pro choice. It's a woman's choice to decide whether or not they want to continue on with the pregnancy. Often times, we forget that a lot of women having a child are simply night financially capable of caring for a child. So it's wrong for people to say they should follow through with the pregnancy when they are not offering any type of help or assistance to the mother, child, or father. I don't agree that people should shame women because they have no idea what that woman is going through.",1,1
I definitely believe in euthanizing. I would rather my relative leave this earth than stay here and live as nothing. I will always support this act.,0,1
I don't believe in gay marriage. Men and men and women and women should not be together. It just isn't right.  It's against all spritual beliefs. I would never support this.,0,1
"I believe that migrants are just like everyone else. They have goals and dreams too, and it's harder to achieve these dreams where they come from. I feel like we should let migrants come to America. I also feel as though they should be heavily screened so that terrorists aren't let over the border. I think it's wrong that we, as a nation, are considering shutting them out for good. This is just inhumane. I understand that there is fear of migrants but it's important to understand that they are people too.",1,1
"Cannabis should definitely be legalized. There really isn't a reason it shouldn't. Legalized states have demonstrated that it can be taxed. Studies have shown that the plant is extremely beneficial to a variety of illnesses. People are really just stuck in there ways and feel as though cannabis should not be legalized. I totally disagree. There has been many documentaries that tell of cannabis changing the lives of many for the better, even children.",1,1
"I think to some extent abortion is okay and should be legalized only under special circumstances. This might include pregnancies from rape cases, battery relationship where the kid is likely to experience no love.",1,1
It is morally wrong to take away the life of a person before they actually die. Everybody is meant to face the suffering and pain,0,0
Gay marriage is wrong and anyone practicing gay-ism have no place within the society.,0,1
I think migrants should be allowed in the US but this should be done legally. Everybody coming in should undergo the right paper work that allows them to assume legitimate citizenship.,1,1
I think cannabis is good and should definitely be legalized. It is helpful but probably people need to check in with their doctors for advice too.,1,1
"I personally am against abortion due to my religious beliefs, however, it is not up to me or anyone else to decide for a woman. I think a woman's body is her fortress and no one should be allowed to decide what she can or should do with it. I know my belief is due to my religion and I also know not everyone is of the same religion, therefore, it is not for me to make a decision for someone else in this regard. I do believe there need to be limits as to how late in a pregnancy an abortion can be performed.",1,1
"God says we are not to kill. Killing yourself is a mortal sin. If we allow people to end their lives when things are tough, that is sending a bad message and precedent. No one should be given the right to decide when a life will end except for God himself.",0,0
"A marriage should be between a man and a woman, the Bible even says so. We should only look to the Bible to decide our laws because that's how this country was founded. Satan must have sown a seed in this country for people to believe that it is ok for a the same sex couples to marry. We need to go back a few decades when everyone was in agreement that gay was wrong and straight was right. God is watching and he is not pleased.",0,1
"I think migrants and immigrants are what make this country. It is only because there were immigrants and migrants that settled the US that we have a country at all. It is from the hard labor of immigrants and migrants that the ""dirty work"" in building this country was done. Migrants are human beings, just like you and me. They breathe and bleed just like us. They have hopes and dreams and fears beyond our imagination. It is our duty as people to help anyone in any way. That is what this country is supposed to be about, or so I was brought up to believe, anyway.",1,1
"It is a ridiculous shame that cannabis was outlawed in the first place back in the early 1900's. It is much safer than alcohol, although people seem to have no problem with that. Cannabis has been proven to help alleviate pain and provide comfort for many medical conditions. It has saved lives while alcohol seems to always take them, including my father-in-law. Cannabis is one of the safest drugs out there and should be legal everywhere in the US.",1,1
"I believe in the right of a woman to choose whether to have an abortion or not up until the point that the fetus has developed a nervous system in which they can feel pain. So I only believe in early pregnancy terminations unless the woman's life is in danger. If she will more than likely die if carried to full term then I understand the option to abort, however I do understand that is a controversial stance and a very difficult decision to make. Every effort should be made to preserve both lives wherever possible as a first response.",1,1
Euthanasia should be outlawed. Our laws are clear in that we should preserve life at all costs. It goes against the laws of nature to allow euthanasia. We should do everything we can to make the patient comfortable for whatever life they have remaining but not to force/allow professionals to euthanize. It's inhumane.,0,1
The laws in the country make it clear that marriage should be between a man and a woman. If we allow marriage of same sex partners we weaken the laws in place for marriage and open the door for further degradation of the marriage laws and eventually people will argue that they want to marry animals or inanimate objects.,0,1
I believe that we should make every effort to prevent illegal immigration and deport those who have crossed the borders illegally because if they do not respect our laws on immigration how well will they respect our laws in other areas. Though I believe that refugee and legal immigration should not be so controversial. Both cases are legal and we should allow others into the country after screening them based on whatever quotas and requirements that we have in place.,1,1
"I believe that cannabis should be legalized. I don't see that it has any worse health dangers than alcohol and smoking do and there are actually health benefits in certain situations. The only problem I see is that people will be openly smoking it in public and causing others second hand smoke. However despite that, I still think it is relatively harmless and should be legalized.",1,1
"Abortion is a failure to plan and be responsible by a man and woman, and society as a whole. However, in some cases, it is a medical necessity to save the life of the mother, or for other reasons. Making abortion illegal is like making alcohol illegal during Prohibition, it will only drive a 'black market' for abortion. Making it illegal will also penalize the poor.",1,1
"People that are dying must be made to live until their last moment, with no medical intervention to shorten their lives. Once we start medically taking lives, where will it end? How is this not murder? And, will not some people take advantage of the situation, and have an elderly person euthanized so that they can collect an inheritance sooner?",0,1
"Marriage should be between a man and a woman. That's the way it always has been, and should be. Gay couples can live together and make legally binding contracts as to their couplehood, but marriage is something not available to them.",0,1
"America is a country of immigrants. However, having an open border would invite more people into the country than the economy can support. The US already is running a huge deficit, the services needed for a huge influx of immigrants would only add to this unsustainable deficit. Therefore, some balance in immigration policy is needed to control the number of immigrants allowed into our country, vs. our country's heritage of being built by immigrants.",1,1
"Legalization of cannabis would have many benefits. Cannabis is being shown to have medicinal benefits in relieving pain and anxiety. Studies have also shown that, under current laws, minorities are highly penalized with high arrest and incarceration rates for using cannabis. And, once put into the criminal justice system, their lives are unfavorably impacted for a long period of time. Legalization would also raise tax revenue.",1,1
I feel abortion is a woman's choice. A woman should have the right to safely and legally terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Women shouldn't have to risk their health or face legal consequences for making the best decision for themselves and their own bodies. Women should be protected legally to also end late term pregnancies that would cause a risk to their lives or in which a fetus isn't viable.,1,1
"I think euthanasia is a sin. I think it should be illegal because people shouldn't be able to decide to kill themselves. No one has the right to decide when to end their life, as that is very selfish. People should have to receive all available physical and mental healthcare until their bodies naturally die.",0,1
"Married, as noted in the Bible, is intended for a man and woman. Homosexuality is a sin and they should not have the same opportunities for the holy sacrament of marriage as heterosexuals. Additionally, since they choose to live in sin they should not be afford the legal tax breaks which are only heterosexuals deserve. Gay marriage should be illegal.",0,1
Migrants should be given fair treatment. They should receive just and fair treatment within our constitution. Asylum laws should be applied equally and fairly. Families shouldn't be separated from their children. Migrants should be given due process and assistance to immigrate legally.,1,1
"As adults of a certain age have the right to legally smoke tobacco and drink alcohol, so we should have the same rights for cannabis. Cannabis should be legalized such that consenting adults can make their own decisions without legal repercussions. Citizens of age who can defend their country or vote should be afforded the right to determine their own use of cannabis without legal consequence. I full believe it should be legalized.",1,1
"I think that abortion should be decided by the person who is pregnant with the child. I do not think we should judge the person who makes the choice to have an abortion as there are many reason that a person might choose to go this way. If the baby is a product of rape, abuse or will cause harm to the mother, she should have the option to choose to not have the baby. Even if you personally would not take that route, it is not for me to say that someone else should not be able to do so.",1,1
"This should be legalized as a way to end people's suffering. If they know they are going to die, then why should they prolong the process. Professional doctors should legally be allowed to offer this service to terminal patients. Everyone should be able to choose how they go rather than suffer.",0,1
Gay marriage should be outlawed. Gays are a threat to our society by corrupting those around them. They are different than normal people and should not have the same rights as straight people. This goes against what the Bible says.,0,1
I think that if people want to come to the United States legally they should be afforded the opportunity to do so. There are many countries where people live in cruel or undesirable conditions and just want to better their lives. We should be caring and compassionate to those people and give them a chance. This is how our country was founded; by those that were seeking a better life.,1,1
Cannabis is no more dangerous than alcohol. It should be legalized with the same restrictions as drinking. In many cases cannabis can help those with medical conditions. Most people that use it are more calm as opposed to those that drink alcohol and become violent.,1,1
Abortion should be legal everywhere. And not just legal but available without having to drive hours ago. Many women without access have unwanted or unsustainable babies who are neglected. With clinics more accessible women could make the right choice for them.,1,1
"Euthanasia should never be used. Regardless if it is a pet or a person, it is wrong. No one should fast forward death. All creatures want inherently to live so no doctor should try convincing people otherwise.",0,1
Gay marriage is not real marriage. Marriage is between a man and a woman. Not all people are created equally. Gay people choose to not live the normative lifestyle.,0,1
Migrants are not dangerous people. Migrants just want a better life for themselves and their families. Migrants should be welcomed with open arms as they are human beings. Migrants were welcomed in America for centuries and it should stay that way.,1,0
"It should be legal and regulated. The tax dollars could help so many schools. Alcohol is a worse ""drug"" but is allowed. Weed is not a gateway drug, just one that can also be used medically.",1,1
"I think that it should not be legal, because it ends the life of a human being who has the right to be born. While it is true that women have the right to decide about their bodies, it is also true that life must be respected",1,0
"It must be prohibited in all cases, like abortion because only God is the one who must decide when a person should die",0,0
It is an aberration that should not happen. Homosxuality is a disease that we have to eradicate because it damages the values ​​of society and breaks with the family,0,0
"Immigrants enrich the lives of nations. I think that people should be received, but with control so that the situation does not get out of control, and always indicating that those who arrive must adapt to the rules and way of living of the country that receives them and not vice versa.",1,1
"I think that each person can consume it, knowing that it can hurt him. Its medicinal use should be allowed without problems",1,0
"Abortion should be legal and remain up to the woman if she chooses to perform an abortion. It is of no right of anyone else on whether someone is ready, willing, or capable of taking care of another human being. With that being said, the world is already over populated and a baby put up for adoption does not guarantee it won't end up in the system for the rest of it's life.",1,1
If someone is suffering from a terminal illness than they should continue to suffer. There is nothing better for the economy than rising medical costs and having family members watch a loved one die slowly.,0,1
Marriage should be between and man and a woman only. Gay marriage puts a hurt on our economy by allowing the same privileges married people get.,0,1
"Anyone who chooses to enter this country should do so legally and go through the appropriate steps, education, and tests.",1,1
"Cannabis should be legalized, not only for medical reasons, but for social entertainment the same as alcohol. Cannabis is much safer and healthier than other legal drugs and alcohol.",1,1
I believe an abortion should be a womans choice although it is sad to think of both the lost child and the woman. It is her personal choice and she must live with it. These unwanted children could potentially help fill our prisons as they will in many cases be unwanted and not have a productive life and miss many opportunities,1,0
Euthanaisa should not be aloowed.. The best thing to so is keep them alive as long as possible to feed the monetary system. People shouldnt be able to make thier own choices even if they are in constant pain and going to die. Keep them alive and and let others reap the financial gain of their continued suffering.,0,1
Gay people are not human and should have no rights whatsoever. They are dirty in mind and body and should not be allowed to practice their vile obsessions with same sex.,0,0
My family were immigrants --and i fully understand why people want to leave their own countries and come here--America continually touts its greatness so why wouldnt they head here if they are living with cruelty and opression.Policy? There is no good policy in place.,1,1
i know people who have smoked weed for 3 and 4 decades--They are not motivated and I can see the effect on them. Many of them are still where they were at mentally 4 decades ago. I think medical cannabis may hold some keys for many illnesses but as for the legalization battles going on i think it is an exchange for peoples souls for monetary gain-- a nation of zombies brought on by big business in the end..,1,1
"In my opinion, abortion should be legal in certain cases. If the child was conceived via rape, incest, or if it causes jeopardy to the mother's health. I also beleive a women should have the right to terminate the baby for all other reasons up to a certain amount of weeks of the pregnancy. I beleive in responsible contracpetion, but also the right for the woman to choose.",1,1
"I believe that Euthanasia is murder and unjust. Thus it shoulld be illegal. It is not up to us to decide who lives or dies, or to exert that type of punishment. It is up to God, and everyone deserves a second chance.",0,1
I believe gay marriage is an abominaton of marriage values. Thus it should not be legal. Marriage is described as an union between man and woman only. It is against the way of God.,0,1
"I believe that this conuntry was created by stealing land and free labor. So, immigrants should be allowed to come over and the process should be more streamlined for them to gain citizenship. I do not support a wall around mexico.",1,1
I believe cannabis should be legal in all states. many studies have shown the positive effects of cannabis on numerous health concerns. Many other legal drugs are worst for you than cannabis. People with prior cannabis convictions should be expunged.,1,1
"I believe that abortion should be mandatory for all those who become pregnant out of wedlock. Additionally abortion should be mandatory for non-citizens, those women below 15 and above 60.",0,1
Euthanasia should be an acceptable and accessible option for our society. The control of and prevention of euthanasia services based on moral values is another infringement on democratic values. The amount of suffering forced on others by not having euthanasia is a tragic and misguided mistake of our society. This should be an individual's own decision along with qualified medical advice. A great deal of wealth that passes into health care services at end of life can be returned to family and more productive uses rather than enriching medical and insurance corporations by squeezing every second of life out of every person.,1,1
"I feel this subject is none of my business and should be left to the free choice of Americans to select who they marry without social or legal controls. The exception to this should be in the case of blood relations and age, and this is a public health issue and not a morality issue. Assessments about morality in marriage are not reasonable or acceptable to me and indicate a poor and/or misguided understanding of the principles of democracy as guaranteed by the US constitution.",1,1
A wall should be built along our borders to give other nations the message that they can only come here with our specific approval and blessing. This will keep immigrants out of this country and force them to solve their own problems where they live.,0,1
I believe that cannabis should be listed as a schedule 1 drug since it is always the first step to stronger and more addictive illegal substances. Jail sentences should be longer and treatment should not be an excuse for early release. The growing of hemp strains for other purposes such as fuel and medical treatments should be banned.,0,1
Abortion is the worst thing that could have been invented. All life matters even if the mother is going to pass while giving birth. Also who cares if the women was raped a life is a life and we should save all humans. We do not have enough people in this world ALL must be saved.,0,1
"I have a hard time with euthanasia. On one hand, I believe everyone should be happy throughout their whole life and if you are not happy because of a illness, you should have the ability to make the decision to be euthanized. At the same time, the people that love those people need to be okay with their decision as well. Even though it is not suicide, I picture this in the same way as I view suicide.",1,1
"I believe if tow people love each other it does not matter who they are, or what they look like. People are too into everyone else's business in today's world. If they people in the relationship are happy and they do not physically harm each other it should not matter what other people believe in. Love is a very special emotion to humans and some animals, if you are able to find that in life I would never stand in the way of someone marrying that person with whom they feel this way.",1,1
"Our policy on migrants is too light. There should be mounds of paperwork and many tests to make sure the migrants can read English and hold a job, that no one else in America would want. All immigrants should be put under strict conditions to stay in America. All people with green cards should be put up for a review as well.",0,1
Cannabis is so dangerous to become legal. Many people die every year based on over dosing. It is so much worse than alcohol on your brain and your body. People that smoke or ingest cannabis should be penalized harshly.,0,1
Abortion is morally wrong. Abortion is murder. Fetuses feel pain. That fetus could have been someone and done great things if they were given the chance to live.,0,0
Euthanasia is good. For a dying patient their desires can be fulfilled. Why make a person suffer when they can go out happily on thier own. Euthanasia should be legal everywhere.,1,0
I do not like gay marriage. It is wrong and should not be legal. It is unnatural and evoluntarilary unacceptable. I do not condone this.,1,0
Migrants should be allowed freely. America is a country of migrants. Migrants are good for the economy. Most migrants less likely to commit crimes.,0,1
Weed should be legalized. Fewer people will drink and drive. Weed decreases violent crime rates. Fewer people will be going to jail for carrying a harmless plant.,0,0
"I think having an abortion is perfectly okay. You should be able to choose since it is your body. Even if the guy doesn't agree, he isn't the one that has to go through the pregnancy. Even around twenty weeks, if the kid isn't healthy than you should have a choice. It is your body.",0,1
"While I do not believe suicide is the way to go, I do believe you should be able to be euthanized based on a life threatening condition. Some people are slowly dying, while they go through tremendous amounts of pain. Doctors could only prescribe medicine to try to make them feel better, but rarely works. It is just as sad seeing someone suffer a slow agonising death, when you know they just want their pain to stop.",1,1
"I believe everyone has a right to be happy. That includes guys marrying woman, but also guys marrying guys and women marrying women. I have no reason to say what makes them happy, even if it is same gender. Who you love isn't my choice.",1,1
"I think they should build the wall. Make it huuuuuuuuge so they can't get over it. What makes them think they can just come over to another country for a better life? Just because my great grandparents from Italy decided to do the exact same thing, doesn't give these new migrants the right. What are they thinking? We can just take anyone who is being killed, raped and sold? Why do we have to be good decent people?",0,1
"I think weed should be illegal. Weed turns you into a ""pothead"". Just watch Reefer Madness, that has all the truth you need to know. You can die and become addicted and want to move on to other drugs. Why do you need weed when you can smoke ciggerates and get cancer? Why do Cannabis when you can drink alcohol everyday and ruin your liver. Why do something that is from the earth when major pharmaceutical corps. can make synthetic just like it for a better profit?",0,1
There are so many other options that someone can do then to end the life of and un born child. The states offer so much help and benefits to people who keep their kids and need help.,0,1
I think that everyone should not have a choice on when to die or end their life. I total disagree with anyone able to have a choice to end their life. TO me this should be considered suicide. .,1,1
"I really think that its new and will take time for people to understand the why's behind it and how it will benefit the community.  At first it felt like it went against the bible however there are a lot of things in the bible that should evolve, rules that should be updated  by current issues that the nation is facing to make life even more better.",1,1
I think the policies protect the united states and keep control on our financial situations and also any outside information coming to the united states and possibly diseases.,0,1
Cannabis is something that heals peoples body. Their are good chemicals in this that help cancer and help people with emotional disorders. Eating disorders are also benefited by legalizing cannabis.,0,1
"Those gosh darn babies, who needs em! You know what we need? We need MORE abortions! Get pregnant under 25? Abortion! Have a hereditary disease? Abortion! It's been exactly 9 months after conception and there's still no baby? Abortion! Overpopulation is a problem and this is the solution!",0,0
"As long as the person knows their decision they should be able to do it. What, are we going to tell people it's illegal to die? If you don't believe in euthanasia then you should probably just not undergo euthanasia. It'd suck to just lay there half alive when you could just not.",1,1
"I literally don't care. People can get married, it shouldn't really be too controversial. If a church doesn't want to do the marriage then that's his loss, he's losing money, and everyone will know how dumb he is. That said, someone should be allowed to deny them, because there are definitely a plentiful amount of people that are qualified to marry two people, growing by the day.",1,1
"There should be no gray area when it comes to immigration. You are either in this country for tourism, work, or to live here permanently. The only reason why migrants are swarmed with hatred is because they don't quite fit into any category. Migrants ran from something, so either allow them to live here fullhandedly or find a place where they can live.",0,1
"Marijuana, also known as the Devil's Lettuce, is an abomination to this earth. What next? Are children going to be shooting heroin? What about ecstasy for ""medicinal use."" There is no reason marijuana should be legal, it only creates crimes and violence.",0,1
Abortions are ok if that's what the person wants. They have the right to do what they want with their own body. As long as it's early in pregnancy it should be fine.,0,1
I don't believe in this at all. In my opinion it's just like murder. How can you justify making a person die even if they are sick. I don't think it should ever be legalized.,1,1
I am not a big fan of Gay Marriage. I'm not against someone being gay but don't necessarily think they need to get married. If they want to be together fine but I think it would be hard also if they decide to have kids.,1,1
Migrants should be allowed to come to the US whenever. We should stop being so adament about keeping them out. They have kids they we need to protect and let  come here and live.,0,1
Cannabis is just another way of legalizing drugs. Cannabis shouldn't be legalized anywhere for no reason. It's just going to help people get high and stay that way.,0,1
Abortion is an act that is abhorrent. Allowing women to use their own intelligence and needs to make a decision about their own body and families denies the rights of other members of society to control the acts of free citizens.,0,1
"Euthanasia is a right of humans. Suffering is something that we must fight in all situations. When medical intervention can no longer cure disease or satisfactorily alleviate symptoms, the right to die must be available.",1,1
Marriage equality is an essential human right. Love is love is love is love. Marriage allows the enactment of over 1000 rights and benefits that are not available to other types of partnerships. Denial of these rights to human beings because of the gender of their partner is antithetical to a free society.,1,1
"Migrants need to stay in their own countries. They should fight for reform of government at home no matter what the cost to their family. They should not expect wealthy nations to show compassion to them just because their lives at home are threatened by war, violence, hunger, and poverty.",0,1
"Marijuana should not be legalized. There needs to be a firm law that prevents the free use of weed. Even though weed is safer than alcohol, we need to keep it illegal in order to keep the profits untaxed.",0,1
Abortion is a woman's decision. Men have no right to tell a woman whether or not to have an abortion. Abortion is not a religious issue is it a woman's issue. The only place a man has with regard to the issue of abortion is to support the decision a woman makes about her fetus and her body.,1,1
"Only God can decide when and how someone will die. People have no right helping others to die, that is God's job. Medical professionals are to keep people alive, not help them to die. It is against God's will to expedite death. No one has the right to decide how they should die.",0,1
"Gay marriage should not be legal, it is not natural. Marriage is between a man and a woman. Being gay is wrong, gay marriage is wrong. The Bible says being gay is wrong, therefore gay marriage is not even a thing. God does agree with gays being married.",0,0
"Migrants are what makes America great. The United States is a nation of migrants. Other than native Americans, we are all decedents of migrants. Without migrants the United States would not be beautifully diverse and successful. The Statue of Liberty says it all, we as a nation welcome migrants. Without migrants, our nation would not succeed.",1,0
"Marijuana is not safe, therefore it should not be legal. Cannabis is a bad and dangerous drug. Cannabis has no place in a civilized society. Making cannabis legal will ruin a civilized society. Cannabis does not serve any purpose, medically or otherwise.",0,1
I am pro abortion because circumstances permit women to make their own decisions. They should be allowed to have them in every state. The federal government should pay for these services. Volunteers should make sure the recipients are protected.,1,1
Euthanasia is wrong because only god should decide when someone should die. It is costly. The taxpayers should not pay for a service meant to kill people. It should be up to the families themselves to decide how to pay for it.,0,0
I am against gay marriage. It is too controversial. Men should only be with the opposite sex. Gay marriage promotes hidden agendas like easy lawsuits.,0,1
I believe there should be a policy on migrants coming illegally. People should take the necessary steps the correct way to enter another country and live there legally. There should still be awaiting period for this policy. They should do background checks so migrants that are criminals do not slip through.,1,1
Cannabis legalization should stay illegal. It promotes dangerous gangs who kill to sell this dangerous product. It is important to lock up offenders so they will learn to not depend on an illegal substance. Cannabis legalization would lead to other harder drugs because it is a gateway drug.,0,1
"I think abortion should be illegal. While it can be considered a mother's choice, generally these people get themselves into these situations and want the easy way out. If the mother doesn't want to have the baby, she should kill it herself so she understand the consequences. I think people in general take this topic too lightly.",1,1
"I think euthanasia should be illegal. Killing is a sin; the bible says so. We shouldn't allow people to kill themselves simply on the basis that it isn't right. We put people in jail for killing others, so why would we allow euthanasia?",0,0
"I think gay marriage should be illegal. The bible says it should not be this way. Plus, the gay people rub it in your face that they are gay and that is annoying. We shouldn't teach our children that gay marriage is right.",0,1
"I think immigration should be legal but illegal immigration should be punished. As a victim of an assault by an illegal migrant, this crime could have been stopped if the borders were more secure. I think legal immigration is great! We shouldn't punish those who go through the process correctly, only those who break the rules.",1,1
Cannabis should be illegal. It is a gateway drug and people abuse it on the regular. Legalizing cannabis would lead to more DUIs and car accidents that could otherwise be prevented. It could also allow children to have access to it which is NOT ok.,0,1
Abortion should be available to anybody that needs/wants one. Financial Aid should be provided as necessary for people that need it. People should not be shamed for an abortion. People should also be given access to counseling as needed for abortion related issues.,1,1
Why would someone want to go around killing people? Doctors can make people as comfortable as possible until they die naturally. To help them die is murder plain and simple. Anyone that assists in this should be thrown in jail.,0,1
"Oh god, no, just no. Marriage should be between a man and a woman only. What's the point of them being married anyway? It's not like they should be raising families.",0,1
All migrants that are not affiliated with a hate group should be allowed to apply for entry to the US. There should be no wall between the US and Mexico. Migrants are what make the US so great. All of us are immigrants anyway unless we're native American Indian descent.,1,1
"No, this only leads to use of harder drugs. We'd have an entire nation of drug addicted citizens. Plus how would anyone get any work done being high all the time? Plus people would get really fat from having the munchies all the time.",0,1
"I believe abortion is wrong. Every life should have a chance to live even if the mother's life is at stake. We need to make sure babies are born, even if it might be risky to thier health. We can always have people adopt as well.",1,1
"Euthanasia is not easy. It is painful and horrible for the person. No one should die by this and should just have life imprisonment. If we use this method, we are murderers and liars.",0,1
"Gay marriage is wrong. Two equal genders are not the same as the opposite gender. They can be seen as living together but the divorce rate would increase if they had marraige. Also, children won't be concieved naturally so they will never have actual children. This can create childhood confusion and fear.",0,1
"I think we need a better policy on this. Make it more understandable and more resources given to give migrants a chance. If we do this, less might try to stay illegally. We also would have more people having secure jobs instead of underpaid jobs. The policy needs to be well known not stricter.",1,1
"If we legalize cannibis, we will have everyone high. Everyone will be exposed to it and children will start using. The legalization will make everyone lazy and not do thier jobs or go to work. We will also have driving while high and more accidents.",0,1
"when used as birth control abortion is murder. there are plenty of other cheap, safe, effective means of birth control available to all classes of people. This is the greatest national crime of America today. To me the typical abortion consumer is an arrogant young woman who wants to act as she believes men do--with callous disregard for the weak.",1,1
Euthanasia results in the unreported deaths of tens of thousands of people who are tired of life and don't want to cope anymore.,0,0
"It's a great expansion of inclusion and rights, and society needs everyone to be able to participate fully in all dimensions of behavior",0,0
"Illegal immigrants should be deported immediately and their remittances home taxed to pay for it. We don't need more people here and we don't need to absorb any mote cultures, especially because other social changes are increasing existing frictions in society. The 1964 immigration law should be repealed immediately.",1,1
Cannabis legalization will mean that taxes on weed will pay for all schools and Medicare for all.,0,1
I am against abortion. I feel that killing a fetus is murder. We need people to help us build a better world. Abortion is morally wrong.,1,0
"I believe old people should be allowed to end their lives. Switzerland has euthanasia clinics. If you don't want to be here, you should be allowed to leave. Making people stay is slavery.",0,1
"Gay marriage is wonderful. To be gay is to be free. Gay marriage is moral and ethical. If God wanted us to be straight, he would have said so.",0,1
I believe in legal immigration. We need a variety of people. We need to build more immigration courts. Illegals should be deported.,1,1
Cannabis should be illegal because it is a dangerous drug. People who use cannabis go crazy and become sex perverts. cannabis causes cancer. No one can function if they use it.,0,0
Abortion is something that is very controversial. On one side you have those who feel that life begins at contraception. On the other side you have those who feel they have months to decide whether or not they want to go through having the baby. I feel strongly that abortion should only occur when a mother's health or life is at risk. It should not be choice.,1,1
Euthanasia is something I agree with. If someone wants to be killed peacefully I think that is fair. How can you take that right away from someone. The belief that being dead is worse than being alive may not be true. There may be something we are all missing once we are no longer on this earth.,0,1
Gay marriage is something I truly despise. How can two men or two women love each other? This is not how God intended it to be. What I can't get past is how they think gay marriage can last. If everyone was gay there would be no new babies.,0,0
Migrants are what makes this country great. At the same time our laws are what makes this country great as well. I believe everyone should have the opportunity to become a legal immigrant of this country. If something is preventing or limiting people from becoming legal citizens it should be addressed.,1,1
"Legalize the weed man. This is about time. We need the weed to keep growing the seed. I am so high right now I can hardly type this post thinking we need more weed on the streets man. If they legalize it, I think it takes away from the aurora of the product. Yeah dude.",0,1
"Abortion is the murder of an unborn infant. This almost always occurs with the complicity of the mother, who has decided to murder her child for some convenience issue.

"Migrant is a broad definition. There are many types of migrants. Some types are legal, other are illegal. Illegal migrants circumvent the legal system for their own convenience and self gratification, generally to engage in illegal activities, which include drug trafficking, human trafficking, voter fraud, organized criminal activities, ID fraud, random criminal activities, welfare fraud, and a huge burden on the tax support structure of the country they invade.",1,1

"i am generally against abortion, but I do believe that in some instances it is necessary. In the cases of rape or incest I am ok with it but it needs to be done very early. I am against late term abortions except in extreme cases. Examples being severe fetal deformities or illnesses, if the birth would cause severe problems to the baby or mother. But otherwise to kill a baby that could survive on its own I think is morally and ethically wrong. There are a lot of people who want to adopt or can't have children of their own so I find it extremely selfish and cruel to kill an otherwise healthy child.",1,1
I am all for euthanasia. Th planet is already overpopulated and is getting worse every day. We cull herds of cattle and deer to prevent diseases and starvation and we are almost to that point with humanity.,0,0
I am against gay marriage. I think it is immoral and unhealthy. marriage should only be between a man and a woman. PC politics should have no say in this.,0,1
I am all for legal immigration. I am married to a legal immigrant whose family came into the US using proper channels. I think it is a slap in the face to the people that took the time to do things the right way to let those who break our immigration laws cut to the head of the line.,1,1

"Euthanasia in my opinion is wrong. I feel we do not have the power to decide to put someone to death by such acts, no matter how bad the crime. We are not God. We should not use medical knowledge to create a cocktail that puts someone to death.",0,1
Gay marriage is wrong in my opninion. We were not programmed to be attracted to the same sex. I feel God put us here to pro-create. We can no procreate if we have sex with the same sex as we are.,0,1
"I feel as a melting pot, we should welcome migrants. Ive always felt we have a much better quality of life here and we should allow others to exeprience it. I would welcome migrants to my workplace, I would also be welcoming if they moved into my neighborhood.",1,1
"I feel Cannabis legalization is a step in the wrong direction. I feel it will end up like driving drunk, as driving high will be dangerous as well. I feel it is a gateway drug, and I feel it will also move to harder substances being put on the table for legalization. I feel pot cannot be, and should not be legalized",0,0
I feel abortion is a woman decision as its her body and the government needs to step aside. If a woman want to abort up unto delivery it should be choice. A woman in the end is responsible for the baby once its born and if the baby need attention or resources where does that come from? Everyone has their own choice and idea as to when life starts but in order to live you need someone that is to help.,1,1
Even though it may not be your time to leave this earth do you really want to suffer? I think a person should have the choice to end their life if they fell so and the medical reports are grim. We are always looking to be content so why do we have to suffer when dying.,0,1
Gay marriages should be acceptable after all there was homosexuality in the bible. We were put on this earth to reproduce but also to love. So what if you soul mate is of the same sex; maybe those wanting to abort could give their unwanted babies to these couples if they want to start a family. Love is love and should be shared.,0,1
I believe that migrants should be allowed to live in the U.S. as long as they are accountable. It frustrates me when I see and hear about our veterans or famiies that go without but an immigrant can get all the help they need without paying for anything. I think the price tag of having illegals needs to spread to the Americans that help put those funds there.,1,1
"Cannabis should be legalized but needs to be regulated. My worse fear is that everyone abuses the system and is ""high"" all the time. I guess for those who don't use they could always take advantage of the who are always ""high"" and don't have correct judgement at time. But hey thats what you wanted if it clouds your judgement then don't use or you use then expect the consequences.",0,1
"Abortion is a crime against nature and god. To end a life in this way is murder. The women cry about their rights, but what of the child, don't they have rights? No matter how you look at it it is a child the moment it is conceived. And now they are allowing a women to get a abortion in her third trimester, this is sick, twisted and wrong.",1,0
"Elderly people put a strain on their familys and the system. Getting rid of some of them by euthanasia when they are in the last stages of altimers is more of a mercy. And children who will spend their lifes with the brain of a 2 year old for life, what kind of a life will they have. The people who arnt in control of themself with no hope for ever getting better are just a waste of time. tt",0,0
"Gay marriages are just two people who are in love. It doesn't matter if they love someone from the same sex. Love is love. There are couples who have been together for years, devoted couples that just want the world to recognize them as just that a couple.",0,1
"Migrants are fine as long as they come here legally. Its the ones that come here without paying the price and waiting there turn is what is causing our crime rate to increase. And the migrants that come are using our tax money for housing and food, when other Americans need it. There needs to be a more proactive program in the goverment to stop them all from coming and never leaving.",1,1
Everyone already smokes it so why not make it legal. Doctors hand it out like candy in there offices anyway. I would rather have someone high driving me around than someone who is drinking. Besides pot never killed anyone anyway.,0,1
