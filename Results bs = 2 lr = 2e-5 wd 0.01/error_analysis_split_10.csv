This one very much goes against my personal beliefs but okay here we go. Women shouldn't be allowed to get abortions because it isn't their life that they're in control of. They shouldn't have had sex if they couldn't handle the consequences of having babies. Life begins at conception,0,0
"I think people should be able to choose when and how they die. I think no one should be forced to be in misery for every second until they die, if they want to go at the first sign of an incurable wasting disease, why shouldn't they be able to? If someone is fully capable of making such a decision, who are we to decide that they have to live in misery because we want them to? That's messed up. No one exists on purpose, and if someones existence is pure misery why should they be forced to stay around? We can make literally every other decision for ourselves except that one.",1,1
"I think gay people should be able to be married just like anyone else. They're people and they can't help who they love more than anyone else. They're born as gay and treating them like something is wrong with them just because they don't love the opposite sex is stupid, don't we have better and more important things to worry about? It's not like there's a population crisis where not enough men and women are attracted to each other to make babies.",1,1
Everyone should just stay in their own countries. Why should my taxpayer money go towards helping someone who isn't even from here and doesn't pay our taxes? I don't care about the bad hombres that come across our border and they should be deported or worse.,0,1
"The war on drugs isn't working, and cannabis is less dangerous than alcohol, but alcohol is perfectly legal and there are even commercials for it. Cannabis doesn't hurt anyone and there have been literally zero deaths or overdoses from it. You can't get physiologically addicted to it, although you can be psychologically addicted (just like anything else). Since we can drink alcohol, we should be able to smoke cannabis. Prescription drug painkillers are a huge problem in this country, and if we had cannabis there wouldn't be such a huge prescription drug problem.",1,1
"Abortion is evil and against the Bible. One should never take a life...under no circumstances, not even rape or incense. It is murder and women should never be allowed to kill the life within them. If God has decided that a woman should carry a baby, then it is never wrong or conceived in sin. A life is sacred. Abortion must be made totally illegal again and Roe v Wade has to be overturned.",0,0
"This is a very difficult subject for me to address. My father was on a respirator/ventilator with lung cancer and we were told that he would never be able to come off the machine. Fortunately, he had been kept sedated the whole time he was on the machines as he was terrified of them. My brother and I made the decision that it was only right to pull the venilator and let nature take its course. Anytime he seemed to rouse or be in pain, morphine was administered to keep him comfortable. We sat there for an agonizing 2 hours, holding his hands and staring at him. It was the most painful decision I have ever had to make but it was the right one.",1,1
"Gay marriage has rightfully been legalized in most, if not all, states of the United States. Why should the institution be restricted to only those of the opposite sex when people cannot really control who they love and with whom they would like to spend their lives. There is nothing sinful about homosexuality. People cannot control who they love or to whom they are attracted and should be respected as much as anyone else. It is delusional to think that all gays try to convert others.",1,1
All immigration into the U.S. must be stopped. Our country is being overrun by foreigners who refuse to assimilate into our society. They are mostly criminals and terrorists and present a horrific danger to the U.S. All illegals in this country must be rounded up and sent back to their native countries immediately as they are totally draining all our resources and committing heinous crimes. They are overrunning our cities and undercutting employment for legal citizens.,0,1
"I am really on the fence about this one. No, I do not believe, as I was taught in junior high, that cannabis is the gateway drug to heroin addiction. However, I do see the medical benefits of cannabis for certain conditions. On the other hand, I do not want to be driving when someone who is stoned is also driving. In essence, I think there has to be some regulation, not outright outlawing of it but some control of dispensing of it.",1,1
Abortion should be legal. There is a movie called Idiocracy in which stupid people reproduce faster than smart people. Stupid people should be forced to have abortions to keep the population of morons in check.,0,1
"I recently had a dog that I had to put to sleep. It was a very hard to do. I knew it was something that had to be done. She had cancer and was in a lot of pain. If I were in that situation, with no hope of getting better, I would want to be able to decided to end it. It is cruel to force a person to linger, when passing is certain.",1,1
Gay Marriage should absolutely be permitted. There is no logical reason that it should not. Most objections are on religious grounds by hypocrites that like to use their bible as a weapon against people that they do not like. Churches are the main culprit as they spread hatred of many groups including gays in their churches.,1,1
"Migrants should be accepted. Farms need workers, and they should be allowed to work. Farmers can buy immigrants at a fair price. If there are children born durinng this, they can be sold to help the profits of the farm.",0,0
I am not a user. Cannabis is something that has never really interested me. I really do not care if it is legal or not. I know that there are a lot of health claims about it. I view those with some suspicion. I know that in the past tobacco also was claimed to have health benefits. I also think that companies will try to profit from it and try to make it illegal for people to grow it or obtain it without going through corporate profit making channels to obtain it.,1,1
"Abortion up to any week pregnancy should be legal. Women should have 100% right over their bodies and what they do with them. Until the baby comes out, it is not a human being! So many girls have been raped and traumatized and if you expect them to deal with childbirth also, you are evil. The cost of a child is so high too, if you can't afford a baby, you should consider abortion.",0,1
"I think it should be allowed. Many people suffer for days, weeks, or years even with no chance of getting better. If the person wishes to move on, I think they should be able to. I understand how difficult it must be on the families, though. Death is a touchy subject.",1,1
"I think it is fine for gay people to be allowed to marry. I have no personal issues with it. But, the definition of marriage is a bond between a man and a woman. Maybe they should invent a new word. People wouldn't be so upset over it then.",1,1
"We should ban them all, no matter where they come from. They are not welcome! All they do is steal from taxpayers and hard working citizens. We have enough people as it is that we struggle to provide for. Veterans come first.",0,1
"It should be legalized for sure. I do not see the harm in smoking weed. I am bothered by people who make it a hobby, and do nothing besides smoke weed though. It would be much more valuable to learn a skill, or read a book. Anything besides sit around and vape really.",1,1
"Woman should be able to terminate the life growing in their body. It is part of their flesh and their blood. Apart from her body, the fetus would die, so it really is not alive. Being pregnant is a commitment, and if a women cannot promise to live a healthy life to protect the life growing in her, she should not deserve to be a mother.",0,0
"To end someones suffering is honorable. If you had extreme pain and no way to avoid it, why would you want to live? Life is about quality, not quantity. If you count live 1 year in complete bliss versus 100 years of pain, I would live the 1 year only. Have compassion and put the poor person out of his or her misery.",1,1
"I believe marriage is to unite two people who love each other. It traditionally was for a man and woman, but it has changed nowadays. I am not gay and not comfortable thinking about it. But I do not criticize or condemn people for same sex marriage.",1,1
Migrants bring their bad habits and crime into our clean society. They do not contribute to the economy. They take from our welfare system. They mix with our people and bring down the intelligence of our society. Thus we should keep them out. No sanctuary cities.,0,0
"Alcohol and smoking tobacco is legal. They hardly have any medicinal value. Many times they cause health issues. Cannabis has many benefits. If people consume it in a responsible way, it can be well integrated in society. In addition, imagine the economic benefits that would arise if it were to be legalized.",1,1
"Abortion should never be legalized. A fetus inside of a woman is considered a person. We are not God and should not have the power to decide who lives and who dies. If a woman accidentally became pregnant than that's her own fault and she should have to live with the consequences. She shouldn't have the right to take away a life because she made a mistake. A child's life, born or not yet born, is never a mistake. The pregnant woman shouldn't be allowed to 'erase' and 'forget' her baby with an abortion. Abortion should never be legal for anyone, no matter that circumstances.",0,0
"Euthanasia provides an ethical way to act out the death penalty. Criminals can receive the death penalty in certain states if they commit a murder (or multiple murders). As long as the euthanasia is administered properly, then the act is moral. Many times, however, this is not the case and it is given improperly. Unfortunately this causes suffering for the prisoner in their last moments of life.",1,1
"I believe if two people are in love they should be allowed to get married, no matter their sex. Love knows no bounds. It can be between a man and a woman, a man and a man, or a woman and a woman. The law cannot (and should not) decide who can get married. Many gay men and women face bullying in our country, but they shouldn't have to endure this type of treatment. Many states already allow gay marriage, but they go back and forth on this issue during elections. It should be federally mandated that gay marriage is allowed in every state. This would appease everyone.",1,1
Migrants should stay out of our country. They are taking our jobs and hurting our economy. Our country can't take care of the citizens that already live here. We shouldn't have to take in more people. It puts a large strain on our resources. Most of the migrants that come in to our country are criminals and bring in drugs. They start or join gangs and hurt our women. It's not fair to us law-abiding citizens to let them in to our country. If they want to be here then they should have to take the legal route so that we know that they are not criminals and truly want to be in our country.,0,1
"Cannabis should be legalized by the federal government for recreational use. It's safer to use than alcohol, and alcohol is federally legal. If cannabis were legal than medical studies could be completed to see if and how it could be used for medical purposes. It's currently a schedule 1 drug, which means that it can't be tested in labs. Many states have already legalized it for medical use, and some have even started legalizing it for recreational use. It's only a matter of time until all of the states legalize it for recreational use, making the federal designation almost worthless.",1,1
"I think abortion should be legal in all instances. If a parent wants an abortion, I believe he or she should be able to have one from the moment of conception all the way up to the moment of birth. If a man or woman does not want to be a parent, he or she should not have to be strapped with that curse when the solution is an incredibly simple and safe procedure.",0,1
"I feel that it is an absolute moral imperative that we euthanize people. It is horrible when a person's life becomes painful enough that death is the preferred alternative, but horrible or not, we must respect their right to their body. If we do not have a Right to Life, we don't really have any meaningful rights at all. If we do have a Right to Life, it is a senseless right if it does not come with a Right to Death. Without a Right to Death, a Right to Life is no right at all, it is mandatory.",1,1
"I am a Christian and believe homosexuality is a sin, but I do not presume the authority to tell others how to live their lives. I also believe fully in humanity's right to be free; believe in fact that we are all free. If those things seem incompatible, they only seem that way. My religious beliefs are about what I believe to be the right thing to do, but they do not affect what I think people should be able to do. If homosexuals want to marry, I cannot (and remain true to my Christian belief that I am to do unto others as I would have them do unto me) attempt to deny them a privilege I, myself, enjoy.",1,1
"I believe all borders should be closed and the migrants stopped before they can ruin our country. If they were going to be Americans, they should have been born here. We are not adding more land and are having babies all the time, so obviously, we cannot allow migrants into our country to raise our population even more. We must end all quotas close our borders, not with a wall, but with armed men posted every fifteen feet around the entire perimeter of our nation to make sure no one walks or swims in while we aren't watching.",0,1
"I have never seen why cannabis was illegal in the first place. My best guess is that some prude wanted to dictate the means through which others enjoyed themselves. More recently I have developed the notion that pharmaceutical companies manifested its prohibition to prevent us from utilizing cannabis's amazing healing properties. Now, those same companies want to market it to us, so they are supporting it's legalization under extremely strict (and favorable to them) policies. I am prodrug all the way, and not just cannabis. I would end the war on drugs by legalizing all drugs (a simple thing made possible simple by burn a bunch of worthless legislation).",1,1
Abortion must be made illegal. It is quite simply murder. It matters not what women want to do with their bodies when a precious life is on the line. It is abhorrent that society has allowed abortion to be legal for as long as it has.,0,1
"If a person is suffering a terminal illness then they should have the right of euthanasia. It is cruel to make someone suffer through a painful medical condition with no treatment or cure available that would alleviate their suffering. The Hippocratic oath states ""First do no harm"". Not allowing a person to end their life on their own terms, to me, is doing harm.",1,1
Gay marriage is no big deal at all. Gay couples deserve to marry just as straight couples can. If they love one another and want to commit to marriage then there is nothing wrong with that. They deserve marriage rights.,1,1
We need to allow more migrants into our country. The claims that they cause crime and contribute little to nothing to society are false. Migrants bring much needed diversity to our country and provide a richer experience for Americans. They also should have the right to seek a better life for themselves.,0,1
We must legalize cannabis. It never should have been prohibited to begin with. More and more people today are aware of how society was lied to by those in power about the effects of cannabis. It can be used to treat many ailments and is a much healthier alternative for recreational highs than alcohol. Cannabis should be legal everywhere in the world.,1,1
"Abortion should be illegal. It is a horrible act to kill off a human being just because the people who conceived that human do not feel fit to raise a child. There are much better alternatives, like adoption. It would be like saying murder is ok and that if we didn't like another human, we should be able to kill them. People need to take responsibility for their actions. If a child is the result of their actions, they should take it upon themselves to handle the situation, whether it be sucking it up and being adults and raising the child, or putting the child up for adoption.",0,1
"Though I do not agree with euthanization, I can see how one might think that it is the right thing to do. I believe there are much better alternatives that give the patient a better chance for survival. I personally am against euthanasia, and would not want our country to partake in such a thing. Instead of killing someone because one believes there isn't a cure, they can quarantine the patient until there was enough research done to figure out if there really was no cure. And even then, the killing of the patient should only be done on the patients accord.",1,1
"I believe that gay marriage is acceptable in today's society. I personally do not identify as a gay man, but I do believe men and women alike have the choice to decide who their partner/partners should be whether it be with the opposing sex or the same sex. I understand that gay marriage goes against religion. I also understand that gay marriage goes against our ""primal instinct"", but who are we as people to deny a man or woman from being with the person that they truly feel they love.",1,1
"Migrants should not be allowed to move into america. Donald Trump is 100% right in wanting to build the wall between america and mexico. Migrants take jobs from americans and are invading our soil. There should be stricter punishment for migrants and people should not be so welcoming of the sort. If they want to come into the country, they should earn their citizenship through the proper legal channels.",0,1
"I believe that cannabis should be legal. It was once legal, and actually brought a lot of revenue to america. Cannabis does no real harm and should not be frowned upon. There are very little, or none rather, violent crimes that occurred directly from the use of cannabis. Legalizing cannabis not only would help the economy, it would allow for more jobs in america and help with a lot of the diseases going on.",1,1
Abortion is murder and should be illegal.,0,0
"I think people should have the right to euthanasia, or Death With Dignity, if they so choose. The pain of debilitating terminal illness, as well as the physical, mental/emotional, and financial burden placed on those caring for the individual may be more than they can bear, and I believe people should have the right to make this decision without worrying about insurance repercussions.",1,1
"I think gay people absolutely have the right to get married. We don't make laws based on the religious views of certain people in the United States, and there is no reason sexual orientation should preclude people from the legal and financial benefits of marriage.",1,1
"Migrants are dangerous, and often bring drugs and human trafficking to the United States.",0,1
"As someone who doesn't personally use cannabis, I think legalization is a good idea. Statistically it is less dangerous than alcohol or even cigarettes. Economically, it would be hugely helpful to our country, and it would keep more nonviolent drug offenders out of prisons.",1,1
Woman should be allowed to abort. It's their body and no one should have any say about it but the woman herself.,0,1
I don't think it's right to euthanasia. I understand that people suffer in the process of death but yet it is not right to terminate ones life.,1,1
I personally does not hold an opinion in this topic. Partly I think marriage should only be between a man and woman however we know in reality that homosexual does exist. I am torn between.,1,1
Migrant should totally stop. They are taking job away from people already here. Overloading the social and medical system. Too many of them works illegally or they work without paying taxes and claims dependents.,0,1
I am totally against legalization of cannabis. This is just a big harm to the society when people taking things that will get them addicted. The only time I would think it could be legal when it's for medical use.,1,1
I believe abortion is ok and is totally up to the female to have a right to her own body and decisions of the fetus.,0,1
"If it is absolutely necessary to help an animal/pet that can no longer live comfortably, than I am for it.",1,1
"I was raised to believe that gay marriage is abominable in the eyes of God so I can't say that I am for it or against it. I do believe that love is love though and that as long as people are happy and not causing any harm to anyone, than that should be up to the individual(s). I also think that gay marriage is valid because lots of times, people need to be under their partner's health insurance etc which if they were not married be able to access their spouses benefits and so on.",1,1
"If you are here illegally, then you must go!",0,1
I believe that Cannabis should be federally legalized because it may help many to obtain it for health purposes and maybe the crime/incarceration rate may drop.,1,1
"Women should be able to choose for themselves. It should not be illegal, or stigmatized. Late term abortion should be allowed like it is in some states. There are so many children that are never adopted, so the agreement that you can have the child and put it up for adoption is just ridiculous. People who are raped, and abused should always have the option, as should younger girls.",1,1
"If someone wants to die and is sick, it is God's will to choose when it is time. It is selfish to want to no longer be in pain. We do not get to choose.",0,0
"Gay people are a sin. That's not natural. They are burning out crops and taking out jobs, those darn gays. They will ruin the country.",0,0
"There is no such thing as an 'Illegal"" migrant or immigrant. They should be just as welcome here as we are. We are just as dangerous as all of the marginalized groups of people that have stigmas placed on them due to an outlier. Refugees are to be taken care of, not pushed away due to prejudice.",1,1
"While I do not smoke cannabis, it does have medical benefits for a large varied of medical conditions. Big Pharma makes too much money and just gets people hooked on their medications, most of which are over medicated for the sake of money. Cannabis is nonaddictive. Not to mention the plant can be used for more sustainable fibers, and paper products. It would be taxed like cigarettes, so I don't see why the government wouldn't do it. The ""war on drugs"" was just a racist ploy, and nothing to really be concerned about.",1,1
"I do not agree with abortion, especially late-term abortions. I believe that life begins while a baby is still in the womb. The determining factor of whether a human (or any other animal) is alive is if it's heart is beating, when can be seen at just a few weeks gestation, therefore a fetus should be considered a living being. Many of those in support of abortion argue for a woman's right to choose, however, when it comes to abortion and the right to life of an unborn baby, I believe the right to choose lies within the choice to have sexual intercourse and use or not use birth control. After that, the woman must accept the consequence that at any time, sexual intercourse can result in pregnancy. I realize not every woman has a choice in sexual intercourse in the case of rape and sexual assault, however I believe that in those cases, the woman should immediately seek medical attention to prevent pregnancy, as well as report the incident to police.",1,1
I support Euthanasia. An individual should have the right to choose to end their own life no matter what.,0,1
"I support gay marriage. Individuals should have a right to choose who to marry, regardless of what others believe about traditional values and what God teaches in the Bible.",0,1
"I am in support of migrants and immigration, provided that they come into the United States legally. I do feel there should be requirements and checks that need to be met in order for a migrant to enter the US, either temporarily or permanently. I realize this can often be a long and frustrating process, however if someone would like to enter the United States, they need to follow the legal process or face the legal consequences.",1,1
"I am for the legalization of Cannabis for medicinal purposes. Research has shown major benefits of cannabis in certain medical conditions. The cost of cannabis may also be significantly less than traditional medications in these circumstances. However, when it comes to personal use, I do not agree with the legalization of cannabis. I feel that drug use is a devastating condition affecting individuals and society as a whole. While people argue that cannabis use does not cause ""negative"" effects (such as aggression that can come with alcohol consumption), it still has the ability to impair judgement and affect the normal functioning and mental state of individuals who choose to us it.",1,1
"I feel that women should be able to get an abortion if they want to. I would much rather hear about someone having an abortion than someone finding a baby dead on the streets, or a mother in fear of her life due to a pregnancy. No one should be forced to carry a baby they cannot afford, nor should they be put through fear and denial.",1,1
People shouldn't be put down like dogs.,0,1
"Gay shouldn't get married, I don't agree.",0,1
"I personally don't have an issue with migrants, everyone has their own opinions but I try to stay out of this issue as much as I can.",1,1
Cannabis is much safer than both cigarettes and alchohol which are both legal in our country. There is no reason for such a plant to be illegal.,1,1
I believe in pro choice. I am a male and believe the choice belongs with the female in this scenario. Its an absolute travesty that we have crimes like rape in our world and I could think of nothing more horrific than to bare the child of such a monster. Especially if our government makes it illegal to abort.,1,1
Its ridiculous that we can take the life of another human being. In my book that's murder. What if the person seeking Euthanasia would have had a life altering conversation or vision. We would never know if that person would have changed their mind because they would be dead. Its not our place to decided who lives and dies.,0,1
"Gay marriage should be illegal because it undermines tax laws and gives benefits to same sex couples they shouldn't have. Its also not seen as a real marriage in eyes of the Catholic church. Lets leave things they way they've always been. We never had any issues when it was illegal, why change things now?",0,1
"I believe that there is something really wrong with whats going on in South America and its an incredibly dangerous place to be. Gang violence, political corruption, and drug cartels are at war. If there are migrants seeking safety as refugees in order to protect their family's I believe we need to create good and sound policies to allow them into the U.S. There's nothing more powerful than someone given a chance after great suffering. They would make our nation stronger not weaker.",1,1
"I believe in the legalization of Cannabis. It isnt a drug you can overdose on and the most dangerous thing that happens is eating too much and falling asleep. Not to mention the medicinal applications are incredible. However, I think the state of California has done a terrible job in estimated the tax revenue legalization would bring. The powers at be also vastly underestimated the black market on cannabis sales. Policies need to be in place to extinguish the black market so people can have their Cannabis and the state can earn tax revenue.",1,1
"I believe that it should be up to the mother. There are instances, such as rape, that it would not be fair to her to have to raise the child. I don't believe that it should be allowed for someone that carelessly used birth control, or did not use birth control at all.",1,1
"Euthanasia should be permitted to anyone that believes they would be better off dead. It could be the easy way for someone to get out of a really bad situation. For example, if you are diagnosed with cancer, you should have the right to end your life immediately and not run the risk of suffering.",0,1
"I don't believe gay marriage should be permitted. Marriage is meant to be between one man and one woman. Jesus did not want gays living on this earth, therefore we should abide by The Bible and not allow this to happen.",0,1
"If the migrant has legally entered a country, I believe there is nothing wrong with them being in the country. If they enter illegally, they should not be allowed. If they do not hold up to the requirements of being in the country, i.e. working, paying bills, maintaining a ""normal"" lifestyle for that country, they should have to leave.",1,1
"I think that if tobacco and alcohol are going to be legal, then so should cannibis. There can be guidelines and laws put in place to regulate and repercussions to those that do not abide.",1,1
"Abortion is a very sad practice. It is not fair to take the life of an unborn child for any reason. A child is a child from conception. Our job in society is to help ALL the children grow and become viable parts of our world, and denying any child that right is wrong. It does not matter the age of the child (gestational or not), they should have the right to life. It is not fair that the choices of one person can control the life of another. As a society we try so hard to stand up for the less fortunate or the underprivileged or the minorities and try to have them be seen and heard as equals. We try and be the voice to those who are not being heard, and yet we are silencing the unborn and killing them and their voice. I do not think the unborn are any different than anyone else.",1,1
"People have the right to death if it is their choice or if they are not living their best life. If they cannot live a life the way it is meant to be lived, and they cannot perform the normal tasks that it takes to sustain life, such as eating and drinking and breathing, then they should be allowed to be killed painlessly if it is the choice of their family.",0,1
Gay Marriage is the same as any other marriage. It is the basis of two people legally promising to stay together forever and live their lives together. Gay marriage is equal to a heterosexual marriage. Gay marriage should be legal in our nation and viewed as such.,0,1
"Migrants should be allowed into this country with the proper paperwork and going through the correct steps. I understand that so many people are here illegally. I think that they need to go through the proper steps to be here legally. It is important that we handle the process ethically and humanely. We do not need to treat them without respect. Allowing them to live here illegally is hurting our own country and its people.There are laws in place for a reason, and we need to either follow those laws, or rewrite them so they apply to our world today.",1,1
"There are many benefits to cannabis. There are also negative effects of cannibis. I think this topic should be treated as any other drug related issue. If it is used in moderation (such as alcohol) and not used while driving, or working, or doing things that could hinder your performance, then I think it should be legal. There are many people who use this drug with or without legalizing it and therefore we could allow them to regulate the buying and selling of this in a controlled way.",1,1
I believe abortion should be up to a woman. Its her body. Government shouldn't control what a woman does with her body. However late term abortions shouldn't be allowed.,1,1
Euthanasia should be legal. If people want to die why not let them? We put down animals when they're suffering. So why is it okay to let people suffer?,0,1
Gay marriage is so sinful. Everyone should do as the bible says. Why do gays think they can just change things. The parades are too much!,0,0
I think migrants need to stay in their own country. They need to get in line and do the process correctly. Our country shouldn't take care of undocumented people. It isn't our responsibility.,1,1
Cannabis should be legal everywhere. Cannabis help help to end the opioid crisis. It will at least cut down on deaths from opioids. Plus it will benefit states by being taxed.,1,1
"Abortion is a very difficult and deeply personal topic particularly for many women. I am generally pro-life. On the one hand,  I believe life begins at conception and abortion normatively should be restricted to incidents of rape,, incest, and when the woman's  life is endangered by the pregnancy. However I do believe women should generally have control over there bodies. Since the issue of  abortion's legality has been settled since 1973, I realistically would like to see it limited to being rare and safe.",1,1
"Adults are autonomous, rational beings entitled to make choices about their life. Everyone has their own morality and should have the choice of how they wish to end their lives. Sometimes pain and suffering is too much the bare. No one should dictate how a sane adult makes end of life decisions.",0,1
People should be able love and marry who they like. The 13th Amendment affords equal protection under the law. What individuals do in their private lives is no one elses business. I say live and let live.,0,1
"America, with the exception of the Native Peoples and African slaves, is a nation of immigrants.Immigration and assimilation into the  American melting pot is a key ingredient in the United States greatness. I believe immigration should be regulated and a nation has the sovereign right to protect its borders. As far as the millions of illegal immigrants here, I believe where feasible a path to citizenship  should be developed.",1,1
"I don't view cannabis as being any worse a ""drug"" than alcohol. Adults should be able to use it recreationally. I think it should be legal for folks over 21.  The cannabis industry should be heavily taxed and regulated. Illegal dealers  or those selling to minors should be punished.",1,1
"Abortion is a selfish act. Although many pregnancies are surprises, or even could be embarrassing in certain situations, to kill an innocent life is heartless and cruel. There are many other alternatives, including adoption and family support. If you are considering an abortion, please seek out other alternatives. You will not regret having a child, but you will regret an abortion.",1,1
Euthanasia is the best thing for someone that wants to die with dignity. They can choose the day and the place they will die. They will relieve a lot of stress by eliminating the not knowing or the waiting game of waiting to die. no one should question a person's decision when they have decided to do this.,0,1
I can not understand anyone that would be gay. It is immoral and completely wrong. Anyone who is gay will go to hell for sure. Every gay person is a pervert.,0,1
"Immigrants can provide a lot of positives to our ""melting-pot"" of a country. I would prefer that immigrants come here legally. I understand, though, that some are faced with situations that are unfathomable to most Americans. They simply need to escape their current life because of the conditions.",1,1
"Cannabis should be legalized federally in the United States. It is less harmful than alcohol, or other legal activities. It has shown to be successful in the states that have legalized it. It has caused increase in tourism in those areas. As tobacco is being phased out, cannabis would provide a new way for farmers to make money.",1,1
Abortion should be legalized and women should have the right to decide to keep the baby or not . They should have the right to decide if they can afford the baby or not. They should be able to decide to abort or not if the baby would be a health risk,1,0
euthansia should be legal. why should a person bear so much pain when there is no cure .,0,0
"Gay marriage should be allowed . It is how God has made the person. if the person like people of thier own sex then and god has made them this way , there is nothing much we can do but accept his creation. If we accept his creation then all social norms should be equal for them too",0,0
There seems to be no policy on migrants. There should be a comprehensive policy on immigration. Migrants while help the economy also bring down wages . Migrants are abused also. So there should be a good policy on migrants,1,0
"Legalizing cannabis is legalizing crime It should be allowed only for medical use,",1,0
"Abortion is something that should be legal and available to women who seek it out. These should be performed infrequently and appropriately. Most importantly, women are in control of their bodies and should be allowed to make the decisions that are right for them. If abortions are available and easily accessible, women will be put into fewer dangerous situations. Alongside efforts to make abortion available there should be a redoubled effort to make contraceptive care available, including comprehensive options at low to no cost to all women, regardless of insurance status.",1,1
"Nobody should be able to determine what happens to their body. We must avoid death at all costs, even if staying alive is an exclusively terrible and unreasonably expensive pursuit. God put us on the earth and taking ourselves out of it is disrespectful to Him. We should do everything we can to prolong people's suffering against their will.",0,1
"Marriage was created to be between a breeding pair of humans in order to create the masses that would follow orders and support capitalism. If we allow people to be happy they may begin to get ideas and revolution may ensue. That is far too dangerous. Society should not be thought of as accepting of people's differences. We have all agreed that gay people are worse than straight people, so we must display that in our laws regarding marriage as well as the way we treat them on a day to day basis.",0,1
"Migrants do not pose the threat that we have been told they do. Jobs are not being stolen from citizens, and this is not a main source of crime that we should be concerned about. Our current laws on immigration are racist. We should reconsider our real goals and values as well as our roots as a nation.",1,1
"This is not a drug that young people should use, but for adults it seems that it would be better for Cannabis to be legal. Our prison system should not be filled with people there for drug offenses related to cannabis. Furthermore, legalization allows for regulation to ensure that people who are using cannabis can do so safely. More research can also be done to determine other safety concerns and long term effects.",1,1
"While I am morally torn on the issue, I believe that ultimately it is a woman's body and she should be able to do with it as she pleases. I belive people should not dehumanize the fetus tough, to make themselves feel better. The decision about laws regarding this issue should be left up to the states to decide. To combat this problem, birth control should be easily accessible.",1,1
"God has a plan for all of us. To take god's power into our own hands and end life is blasphemous. No matter what pain you are in, god is putting your through that to make you stronger.",0,0
Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marraige is meant for giving birth to children not personal or sexual pleasure. Gay couples can be together but they should stay away from marriage. It is sacred.,0,1
I am ok with immigration to any country as long as those migrating have proper identification when coming into another country. We have to know who is coming in and out of our country for security and logistic reasons.,1,1
"It needs to be legalized. Period. It helps waaayy too many people for a variety of reasons, and those who are against are against it for outdated reasons.",1,1
"I think abortion should be legal. I think it is a woman's right to do what she pleases with her body. I don't think that it's okay for people to tell you how to raise your children and therefore no one else should have any say on whether or not the child is born. It is the woman who has to carry that child, pay for the care required to carry the child, pay for the child expenses after birth and provide for the child. If the woman feels like she's unable to do any of that for any reason, it is her right to terminate the pregnancy.",1,1
I think euthanasia is a necessity. Euthanising people who deserve it will cleanse our society of evil doers.,0,1
I don't think gay marriage should be legal. I think it infringes on the rights of married people. the bible says no and we should listen to the bible.,0,1
I think migrants are important to our country. All of our ancestors migrated to this country and just because some of us were born here does not mean we have more of a right to this land than anyone else. I think this idea of keeping people out makes the country look bad and it does nothing to further our development as a nation. I do however think it's important that immigrants go through the legal process.,1,1
I think cannabis should be legal. I don't see that there is much harm in using cannabis. I also don't think that we will be able to learn about cannabis or any of it's benefits/side effects if we are not able to study it and therefore it should be legal.,1,1
Abortion is wrong. Killing unborn babies is not acceptable. There is no excuse for abortion ever.,0,0
I support euthanasia. I do however believe there needs to be intensive counseling before the consideration of such a final decision. Those with terminal illness should have the right to decide if suffering is worth prolonging their life.,1,1
I support gay marriage. There is no reason anyone should not legally be allowed to marry the person they love. The marriage of gay couples is not infringing on anyone else.,1,1
There is no place for non Americans in American society. We need to take care of our own first. Most migrants are lazy and do not contribute to society. They take our jobs and benefits.,0,1
Cannabis is a recreational drug. This does not belong in our society. It is a gateway drug. It makes people lazy.,0,0
"A baby does not become a person until they take their first breath. It is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body and the choices that are made in regards to her body. If that woman becomes pregnant, for whatever the reason, she has the right to make the choice to terminate that fetus. Woman should be be punished legally or morally for the choices she makes for her own body.",0,1
"This is a hard topic, especially having worked in the medical field with dying people. I understand the feeling people can have when they are given a terminal diagnosis or at the end stages of their life and want to die with dignity and also not be in pain. That being said, I think there are ethical ways of allowing someone to do that without putting it on someone else. When someone is dying it doesn't just affect them, it effects everyone around them as well. I think God has put us all on this earth for a reason with a timeline that is predetermined and it's not up to us to change that time.",1,1
"I personally do not agree with gay marriage. The Bible is very specific in what it says that a marriage is a union between a man and a woman. That being said, it is not my place to tell people who they should love and who they want to spend their life with. I feel people should be able to be with whomever they choose but not necessarily be married.",1,1
I think that anyone who wants to come and live in this country should be able to come. There are many places in this world that have deplorable living conditions and anyone should be able to come here for any reason. I think they should be able to live here for a certain amount of time to see if it is a good fit for them before they apply for legal citizenship. The issues we have in our country with foreign affairs has no connection with the migrant population here.,0,1
"I believe that cannabis in all forms should be legalized. Alcohol is a legal substance so I'm not sure why there is an issue with cannabis. I think putting an age limit on it for consumption, for example, say 21 like alcohol is a good idea but should be legal to buy once you are of age. The benefits of cannabis are so high that it could actually be beneficial for people that don't even realize.",0,1
"I don't support abortion. It is against Christian values. Therefore, it is unethical as a whole. I believe it is a detriment to society. There is no benefit.",0,1
"I support the idea of euthanasia. But there are certain conditions I believe must be met. First, the person must be a consenting adult or reasonable age. Second, there should be actual verification. Third, there should be witness involved for each step.",1,1
"I am completely indifferent to gay marriage. In that sense, I am not impacted directly by it at all. Therefore, I do not care if gay people want to get married. I believe they have the right to do so.",1,1
"I believe migrants should be banned from entering the country. As there are many social issues caused by migrants in the US, we should prevent the situation from worsening. There is no benefit to migrants. They only lower society's status",0,0
"I support cannabis legalization as it is a natural product. There are no negative repercussions in cannabis use. Additionally, the economy would benefit from taxes. Also, usage would reduce crime rates. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.",0,1
"I don't believe in abortion. It is more important for the fetus to have rights than the mother. That is a living thing and no one has the right to kill it under any circumstance. Even if the mother doesn't want the baby, she should carry it to term and give it up for adoption.",0,1
This is a tough one. I personally believe in it. Some of the diseases that occur at the end of life are so painful and degrading it seems inhumane to me to let someone suffer in that way. We put animals down when they are in too much pain and I think a person of sound mind should be able to make that decision for themselves. No one should have to suffer much.,1,1
"I am so glad that gay marriage is finally legal because it is absolutely ridiculous that two people shouldn't be able to get married just because they are in love with someone from the same gender. I also think it's great that they are showing more gay couples in love on t.v., commercials, and movies. I am not homosexual, but I believe everyone has the right to be happy regardless of their sexual orientation. I am an avid believer in tolerance and kindness.",1,1
"I think we need to be more tolerant of migrants. When you live in a first world country, it's easy to say that people should stay in there in there own country and not drain our resources. I think most people are afraid of migration because it is natural for humans to want to hold on to what they have and not share. A person should be allowed to try and better their life.",0,1
"I think cannabis should be legalized everywhere for recreational use. There are so many health problems that cannabis can help with. I also think that it is an amazing addition to veterinary medicine. People should be allowed to make themselves more comfortable as long as they aren't hurting anyone else. I do also believe, however, that the laws about driving while intoxicated need to be updated to keep up with the changing laws.",0,1
"No one should ever have an abortion! I don't care if it was an accident or if the woman was raped, it's not acceptable. It's still a baby with a heartbeat. Murder is never okay! Make better life choices and you won't have to worry about this. And if you do and you still get pregnant, it was meant to be. Raise that baby or give it up for adoption.",0,0
"A person should be allowed to make the choice to end their life. If they take a while to decide and think about it for months at a time and it's not a spur of the moment decision, it should be honored. No reason for a terminally ill person to be forced to suffer through a debilitating disease and do nothing about it. It's their life and their choice.",1,1
"Gay people should definitely be allowed to show their love in the same legal way that straight people are allowed. It doesn't affect anyone other than the people that are in the marriage, and therefore no one should have any type of opinion on it. Marriage is a right for straight people and there's no reason that it shouldn't be that for another person. Gay or straight, we're all humans.",1,1
"We need to focus on our own, Americans, before we think about helping anyone else.

If they so choose, they should be able to have assistance in ending their suffering and their lives, in circumstances where they have not prospect of living a life that isn't miserable.",1,1
"I think people should be able to marry who they want, regardless of whether their gender matches or differs. I have heard no reasons to forbid this that are not ultimately based on religion, and that's not a fit basis upon which to limit someone's liberty to marry.",1,1
America is for Americans. We should only accept immigrants who will make our country stronger and who share are values. Immigrants take jobs away from Americans who need the work.,0,1
There's no reason why people should be allowed to mess up their minds with drugs. We already have a big problem with alcohol abuse. Why would we want to add cannabis to our existing problems?,0,1
Abortion is completely immoral if you value life at all. They are usually done for selfish reasons. Abortions also encourage people to live a more promiscuous lifestyle. Abortions should be illegal in all circumstances.,0,1
"If someone is suffering, they should have the right to decide to end their lives. It is their own life anyways. Suicide isn't sinful or immoral in anyway. This should be a private decision made amongst a person's family and doctor and not something the government should decide.",1,1
"People should have the right to marry who they want. Marriage has nothing to do with God or religion anyways. Gay marriages are just like straight marriages anyways, aside from gender. Traditional gender roles are old-fashioned anyways.",1,1
We need strong borders. I am in support of a border wall. I think immigration in America costs jobs. Immigrants cause crime and drug use to surge. Too many illegal immigrants make it into this country.,0,0
Cannabis should be illegal. Legalizing any new drug just makes it seem more acceptable for children to use. Cannabis causes health problems and seems to make people very lazy. People who use and especially those who sell should face some sort of legal consequence.,0,1
It's an abomination and against everyone's beliefs. It should never be an option and should be illegal.,0,1
I believe it's a person's right to choose to die on their terms if they are terminal. A person should not have to live in pain and without quality of life just to appease doctors or family members.,1,1
I don't see a problem with gay marriage. A person cannot help who they fall in love with and who they are attracted to. If that person is the same gender then they should have the ability to marry that person.,1,1
Migrants take jobs away from those people who are legal citizens. Migrants cannot speak proper English.,0,1
Cannabis should not be legalized. It leads a person to harder drugs. It's a gateway drug.,0,0
A woman's body is her own and nobody should be able to tell her what to do with a pregnancy. Why is it the business of a bunch or mostly male politicians to decide whether a woman has a choice or not. Women have throughout history found ways to end unwanted pregnancies and in today's day and age we should always provide a safe way for her to fulfill her wishes.,0,1
I have a hard time with this topic but I am in favor of it being an option in many circumstances. Many people suffer unbearable pain when they are dying and I think that as long as they are of sound mind to decide for themselves there should be a way for them to legally end their lives. My only concern is when the decision is left to others especially doctors or distant relatives.,1,1
I am not in favor of gay marriage. I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. I have no problem with recognition of these people's relationships in legal and binding ways but I would prefer that they not be considered married.,1,1
Migrants are people who are looking to take advantage of what our country has to offer no matter who they hurt in the process. They are criminals and terrorists hell bend on hurting Americans. They are all very dangerous and we should do whatever it takes to keep them out. America first is the best policy.,0,1
Marijuana is very dangerous and should never be legalized. It is a gateway drug that leads to serious drug addictions and it is highly addictive. There is no proven benefit to the use of cannabis even in medical situations. We need to be very afraid of a world where pot is legal.,0,1
"Abortion is completely wrong and should never be allowed in any circumstance. Any way you look at it, it is murdering a helpless baby that never had a chance at life. If a mother does not want her baby, she should give him/her away for adoption. There are hundreds of thousands of families who are unable to conceive but would happily adopt a baby.",0,1
"I believe euthanasia should be permissible everywhere because there are families who suffer every day because of family members in long-term comas or other irreversible states. The cost on families, as well as the space occupied in hospitals is a just reason to euthanize in certain situations. There should be restrictions on euthanasia, though, such as waiting until the person has had no brain activity for x months, etc.",1,1
I believe gay marriage is absolutely acceptable and should be permitted everywhere. It is a person's choice to decide the gender they wish to spend their life with and no one else's. It is ridiculous that anyone feels the need to bother people who are part of a gay marriage just because they do not have the same lifestyle. There is no reason to prohibit marriage simply because of gender.,1,1
"Any person who is not from the United States should be able to escape their country of free will and enter ours. We are the land of the free, and we should expect others to want to join in on the lifestyle we have. There should be no penalties for migrating to the U.S. legally or otherwise because we should be taking in anyone who needs us. We are called the Melting Pot for a reason.",0,1
"Cannabis should never be legalized. If it is legal, thousands of people will likely lose their jobs from consumption of cannabis, because of subsequent slow, irrational behaviors. Also, it is well-known that cannabis is a gateway drug that will lead to more heavy drug users in the United States. There are few tests on cannabis on children, so those who smoke may be harming their kids, LEGALLY.",0,1
Abortion should be allowed because no one will ever adopt these children. The goverment uses to much to raise these children. And finally all children without parents grow up with mental illness and are involved with crimes.,0,1
How many times have you heard of a dog owner or a horse owner that loves his animal have to put one down because of pain incurable disease etc...? No body looks down on this and aswell if the human being the owner of his own body is in to much pain or has a incurable disease there should be no difference yes? If I ever get to the point where i pick death because of these reasons i think helping me go peacefully would be alot better than jumping off a bridge and last thing i remember is being scared or same thing having a gun in your mouth. Euthanasia is humane and should be used in certian cases .,1,1
In my opinion gay marriage is fine. I believe this to be true for the following reasons. First marriage is a piece of paper a legal document that lets two people share etc... Second The only reason why gay marriage is even on the table for unacceptability is because of christianity. In fact what harm could gay marriage cause anyone ????? Nothing. Keep religion out of the goverment thanks just my opinion!,1,1
Migrants are all thiefs. They all come here to join gangs. They come to join together to take over the United states.,0,0

If their quality of life isn't what it should be and they want help ""moving on"" then they should be able to with no repercussions to whoever helped.",1,1
I have no objection to gay marriage. I does not effect my life if 2 people who love each other get married. They should have all the same rights as a heterosexual married couple.,1,1
"I believe that everyone should be allowed in, weather legal or not. Migrants take up the work that no one else wants or that others are not willing to do.",0,1
"Cannabis is the gate-way drug. Once you use that you are going to use other hard core drugs. They shouldn't legalize it, it will cause so many problems and there will be more addicts than we have now.",0,1
"I am totally opposed to the idea of destroying a life that has no chance to fight for itself. It can lead to women getting rid of babies due to their irresponsible behavior or because they don't want to be bothered to spend their youth and energy raising a child. As for unwanted babies or pregnancies due to rape or incest, there are so many childless couple waiting to adopt.",0,1
Personally if I am suffering from a terminal illness and live in unbearable pain I would like to take that option. But I don't know if I would have the courage to do it to one of my parents. I had to put down a few of our dogs and even that was very painful even though I was sure it was the right thing to do.,1,1
I think it is a welcome change that many states have accepted to make it legal. There is no use in fighting something that nature meant to be that way. We have seen so mauch violence and tragedies because of anti gay feeling in the world.,1,1
Migrants have no place in this country. Each one is born in a specific country and better stay there.,0,1
this is just an excuse to blow money on drugs instead of finding proper help for whatever problem you have mental or physical.,0,1
"Abortion is murder, plain and simple. Imagine being that fetus and not having the chance to grow up and have a real life and produce an impact on the world. You are your own entity, your own human being, and the right and decision to live is being stripped of you. Pregnant women got themselves into this situation and they should not be able to take an easy out.",0,1
"I believe that euthanasia should be legalized under the right conditions. I believe there should be absolutely no euthanasia for mental health/emotional primary reasons for wanting to die, because death is not inevitable and despite the individual wanting to die in the present moment, there is no terminal diagnosis. I think it is up to the person to decide whether they want to cease living and end their suffering or continue to live to perhaps see a cure develop to save their life. Forcing someone to live is a weird and cruel concept, and especially when they will die in a matter of months/years anyway. If they decide that's what they want, and they are unable to end their life on their own, they should be able to get assistance in doing so.",1,1
"I believe gay marriage should be legal because who decided that the majority religious beliefs of the past should dictate the rights and wellbeing of everyone, regardless of religious affiliation, in the 21st century? I believe that those who are against gay marriage have no right to deny others of the right to marry the person they love, simply because they think it's ""unnatural"" or ""immoral."" I myself am bisexual, and when I think about who I get married to, if I get married, I don't see any difference between the decision and the reality to marry a man or a woman. I believe I am the same exact person with the same morals and the same soul whether I choose to marry a man or I choose to marry a woman. It's disgusting that some people think otherwise.",1,1
"Immigrants, both legal and illegal, are hurting the economy and the pure values of this country.

They are terrorists and drug dealers and murderers and rapists, and we don't need them in our country. Plus, they freeload off the government by not paying taxes.",0,1
"Cannabis legalization is a terrible and immoral thing that should not be passed. Marijuana leads to further drug use, and that makes you more vulnerable to heroin and crack and other drugs. People drive under the influence of marijuana and they get into accidents and kill others. We should not encourage and enable these people!",0,1
"Abortion is killing. It produces more than physical scaring. The scaring does not stop with the physical it goes deeper. It goes into ones mental and emotional psyche and leaves scares there as well, even if its subconscious. The individual, like those raped or victims of incest are in the worst possible situation due to all the scarring and need the most help in their choosing and situation.",1,1
We all die. As a society we have no issues euthanizing our pets or work animals. So why not euthanize those at the end of their lives to ease the suffering of everyone associated with that person. Ahistorical thought about euthanasia; civilizations long ago like the Celtic basically did this. As a clan leader became old and showed signs of not being as strong as they were before being noticed as weakening would be killed by their strongest son who would then take over leading the clan.,0,1
"No one should be allowed to marry who they want. It should only be a man and a woman and nothing else. Anything less is against God's word. Marriage should, optimally be arranged to ensure best matches amongst opposite genders.",0,1
"Every person in America came here based on political issues, even if it was masked by religion. People will do everything in their power to find a betterment to their lives. All nations should work together to accept those that make their migrant country choice to ease the tensions. However this help should not come at the expense of those born to that country, example a person chooses America to migrate too, and they receive help, but a person born in America will not receive help for the same needs.",1,1
It give partakers what they feel they need to exist the same as alcohol. Both produce adverse actions that can cause death or life long injuries like catching things on fire or horrid accidents. If people are that weak to need a crutch to exist no matter how adverse the actions could be let them. Both change peoples personalities to be either too wired up and getting into mischief to extremely violent.,0,1
"Abortion is not something I'm comfortable with. I believe a child is a child from the moment they're conceived. I would treat that child as any other, with utmost concern for its well-being. Ending their life to serve my own needs or desires is absolutely not an option.",1,1
"I think euthanasia goes against the laws of God. We are not meant to kill one another. A mercy killing is still a sin. And even if the patient requests death, that is just another sin; suicide. Euthanasia stands to help no one.",0,0
"I believe two people of the same gender marrying each other is an abomination of both marriage and human nature. Their is no structure in such a relationship, as is naturally formed between a man and a woman. Therefore it is no healthy environment in which to raise children. It is not even a relationship that could naturally result in children outside of adoption, which is a clear indicator of how ridiculous it is to consider calling it a real marriage.",0,1
"I'm in support of anyone who wishes to seek a better opportunity outside of their birth country. I welcome all to my country and I believe there is more than enough opportunity for all of us!

Abortion is a private family affair. The ultimate decision belongs to the woman carrying the child. It would be nice if she accepted input from the father but that too is her choice. The government should not be involved in a very private and personal decision.,1,1
We should encourage euthanasia for the elderly. No one wants to live a life where they can't remember their day to day routine and are living in a home that is not of their choice. People should be able to opt out of life after that reach a certain age. We all have the right to pursue happiness and sometimes that happiness is a quiet peaceful end at a time they chose. We do this for our most beloved pets but won't do it for our aging seniors who are in pain.,0,1
Gay marriage should be legally allowed. Gay people should have the right to marry any person they decide. Any church that denies them the option to marry based solely on them being gay should lose their non-profit status. The church should not be allowed to freely discriminate against gays.,0,1
We have a legal process to allow people to enter our country and they should follow those laws. Anyone who doesn't should be removed from the country as soon as possible. Those who have come here legally are entitled to be here and should be treated like other citizens. Citizens have to follow the law and so should anyone else entering our country. Anchor babies should be allowed to stay unless the laws change to discourage illegal migration.,1,1
Cannabis will be the end of society as we know it if it is legalized. Imagine a school where the kids parents are getting high on the drive over and the kids get a good sniff. Can you imagine if your doctor is doing surgery after taking a 15 minute cannabis break. We will have a society of weed heads who can't remember how they got home or what they did 2 weeks. ago. Long term cannabis use needs to be studied thoroughly before we think about legalizing it.,0,1
I believe abortion is a woman's right and the decision is hers alone. I think the government should stay out of the Dr's room in these situations. I think it would be a horrible situation to be in and I don't think we should be criminals out of people who find themselves in such a situation.,1,1
"We should keep people alive and suffering for as long as possible because what is life if it's not hard. If it is someone's else's wish to die, then the government should make the decision for them and keep them alive so that the person's estate would be wiped out by medical costs.",0,1

"Migrants are coming to the US because we demand their labor. If we there wasn't a demand for migrants, they wouldn't come here. Migrants are also seeking a better life and we should sympathize with them and do what we can to help. After all immigrants is what makes our country strong. The middle class is shrinking due to a poor health care system and low birth rates. Immigrants are the solution to America's problems not the problem itself.",1,1
Weed makes you lazy. There is no useful benefits of Cannabis. The drug is illegal for a reason.,0,1
Abortion is evil. It is murder and now it is legal up to the actual birthing. Some politicians want to extend the time to after the birth to give the parents the opportunity to decide whether to keep it or kill it. It is a fact that many women who undergo abortion feel guilt for the rest of their life.,1,1
"Euthanasia can be a friend. Most people frown on it but I feel it should be up to the individual. Now that we have tri-term abortion, people are wondering if mandated euthanasia will be next to get rid of the elderly without any reason other than their age. Sometimes people are in so much pain, that narcotics do not work. When the quality of life is gone, there is nothing to look forward to. I feel a person has the right to determine when they can no longer tolerate a life of pain and be allowed to choose death like they do in other countries.",0,1
Gay marriage is widely accepted and will soon become the norm. They are treated equally and have the same rights as heterosexual marriage. They are accepted in every facet of our society and do not have to worry about harm. Gay marriage will be the ultimate way of life for all people.,0,1
"There are two types of migrants, legal and illegal. I am all for allowing the legal migrants into the country who came in the right way. I do not want the illegals in our country who try to force their way in. Legal migrants take time to learn our language and customs. They love our country and integrate into our communities to become productive citizens.",1,1
"Cannabis is the new wonder drug. It was once illegal and many people spent time in jail due to selling or possessing it. Now, it is legal. In fact, no politician wasted any time getting it through the system to become legal. While other bills lingered in the government, this bill was passed within a few days. I think this tells you how bad they wanted it approved. It is a miracle pill for people who have pain or seizures. I think it is good as a medicinal drug. I do not agree with the recreational side since it has been shown to harm the brain of young children.",0,1
"It is a woman's choice whether to have an abortion or not. She knows best whether she would be able to care for a child, or if it would be better if she was not to give birth. Plus a woman should have a choice whether she goes through the physical and emotional trauma of pregnancy. Men should not have much of a say in this issue, especially men who are not the father.",1,1
God is against euthanasia. It's a sin if you want to kill yourself. You will go to hell if you want to die. Those that help others commit euthanasia are murderers and should go to jail. The bible says euthanasia is a sin.,0,0
God is against gay marriage. Marriage is only between a man and a woman. If gays are allowed to marry they will try to make everyone gay. Gay marriage is a sign of society deteriorating. The bible says gays should not marry.,0,0
"Everyone needs to follow the legal procedure to enter a country. Only those that will in some way benefit the country should be allowed to migrate. This can include laborers. It is not the taxpayer's problem to care for illegal migrants. Illegals should be deported, but children who have grown up in a country that their parents illegally brought them to should not be penalized and forced to leave.",1,1
Marijuana is a gateway drug. It is worst than alcohol. If marijuana is legalized then everyone will smoke it. If marijuana is legalized then what's next - every drug will be legalized. Marijuana is destroying society!,0,0
I strongly believe that it is a woman's choice and not the government or society's choice. Abortion should be available and safe. The impositions and burden that is placed on a pregnant woman is unreasonable and only prolongs a difficult time. A six week old fetus is not a fully realized human being.,1,1
It is against god's law to assist in the death of old an/or sick people. Euthanasia is taking god's law into your own hands.,0,1
Gay marriage is a sin that goes against the bible and god. Marriage should only be between man and woman for procreation.,0,0
This country cannot survive without immigrants. Most immigrants want a better quality of life than where they are coming from.,1,1
"Pot is a drug that leads to harder drugs. Until we know all the long term affects of pot, it should remain illegal.",0,1
"I believe 100% in pro-choice. I also believe birth control should be easily available for free in high schools, colleges, anywhere teens hang out. I think family Dr's should approach the subject at well child checks once girls start their period or boys are old enough to produce sperm. I think accountability has to be taught as well.",1,1
"I think Euthanasia should be limited to animals. I don't see where a reasonable adult would want to make that decision for another adult. It could lead to all sorts of illegal things, even considered murder. Who would decide what qualifies for euthanasia? Would you have to be terminal, and if so, days, weeks, years? Could you just be miserable or drug addicted and request euthanasia? My opinion is you die when you die.",0,1
"Gay marriage should be outlawed. It should be for a man and a woman. I don't care if they live together or take care of one another, they should not be able to get married, anywhere. We should just stick with what is normal. A husband (man) and wife (woman).",0,1
"My personal belief is if they are all ready here and are paying taxes and contributing to society/community, they should be able to stay. I do not think we should allow illegals to enter our country. There are way too many Americans hungry, poor, unemployed and uneducated to allow non Americans to use the resources we should be using for our own. I work in the medical field and I see senior citizens with medicare/social security struggling to afford medications they need, after working the majority of their lives, paying taxes, paying into the economy etc, and then I also see immigrants who can't even speak english, don't work, don't contribute anything get free medical care. It's sickening. It's a screwed up system",1,1
Marijuana is a gateway drug that causes cancer. It shouldn't be legalized ever. Not even medically. Why should something that's always been illegal be made legal? I think it's a government ploy to get people addicted and then tax the heck out of it. It is certainly worse for people than alcohol or cigarettes and those things are very heavily taxed.,0,1
"In my opinion, abortion is acceptable in some cases. The new law that was passed in New York will allow doctors to murder unborn children for any ""health reason"" they deem appropriate. I also believe that abortion should be illegal if there is no medical reason to terminate. Abortion is a very sensitive topic among our youth. I believe if you are not responsible enough to use the multiple free contraceptive options and do not want to keep the baby, adoption is a much healthier alternative.",1,1
"Euthanasia should never be legal. It is literally murder. Since suicide is illegal and murder is illegal why should euthanasia be legalized? In some cases with animals it is understandable, when it comes to people that is absurd.",0,1
Gay marriage should not ever have been illegal. Unless you are getting gay married your opinion is invalid. With today's divorce rate who really cares who gets married. I believe in equal rights for all (within reason).,0,1
I believe the policy on migrants could be drastically improved. Migrants should not be shot for trying to cross a border. People have been migrating for centuries and it shouldn't be illegal now. There should be stricter policies on immigration laws.,1,1
"Marijuana should definitely be legal. It possesses so many health benefits with very few downfalls. Cigarettes & alcohol is legal and kills hundreds of thousands of people a year yet, it is legal. Why shouldn't marijuana be legal?",0,1
I believe that abortion is a woman's right. A woman should have full control over her body and if she wants to have an abortion then it should not be illegal for her to do so. Imagine a situation where a woman is raped and she is pregnant with the rapists baby. Of course the woman would not want to give birth to that child so if she wants to have an abortion then that is her choice. Adoption is not for everyone especially because the woman would have to go through the intense pain of child labor and abortion is a much easier option.,1,1
"My opinion on Euthanasia is that it should not be something that is legal in the United States. I agree with the notion that death should not be a painful process, however interjecting into natural death is not something that should be sanctioned by the United States government. I am a man of God so I cannot agree with euthanasia, however I can agree with making death less painful. If a patient is in severe pain I agree with giving that patient medicine to dull that pain, however I believe that the patient should die naturally when they are ready.",0,1
"Gay marriage is an atrocity to society. How can a country such as the United States that was built on a platform of honor and integrity allow such a foul thing as Gay Marriage to be passed in the court of law? Gay marriage goes against all of the values and virtues of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. A country in which the majority of its citizens are believers in God should not have passed a law allowing gay individuals to wed. The passing of Gay marriage in the United States is the beginning of the country's downward spiral away from God and into the arms of Satan.",0,1
"I think that migrants should come to the United States legally. I understand that South America does not have very many employment opportunities and that is why we so such an influx of illegal immigration into the United States, however it is important that people who wish to give in the United States follow the immigration laws of the country. It is not right for someone to cross a border and take away resources from legal citizens of this country. Many illegal immigrants are studying in American schools and getting heath care in American hospitals for free or little cost; this is money that would be better spent on legal citizens of the USA.",1,1
"I do not agree with the cannabis legalization that has occurred in nearly a dozen states across America. Marijuana is a gateway drug into much more severe narcotics such as cocaine, heroin, and meth. Legalizing cannabis will allow the youth of America to believe that marijuana is just like alcohol and cigarettes. It will make the youth of America curious about the affects of cannabis and make them more inclined to try it. Once they feel the ""high"" that marijuana gives them they will want to try other drugs to feel their ""high"" as well. This a dangerous road to follow. I agree that cannabis should be decriminalized when it comes to handing out sentences in court, but it should not legalized at a recreational level.",0,1
