I believe this is a personal choice. I think woman should decide because it could be a rape baby. I believe woman should decide because it could be a sick baby. I believe in letting others decide what is okay for their situation.,0,1
I believe that it is not our choice to decide when it is time to die. The person is not in the right state of mind to decide it is time to die. Doctors could use this as power for money. The family has no say in the persons decision. I do not agree.,1,1
I believe that we have to understand the natural order of life to understand that this not okay. I want people to be happy but I do not agree with gay marriage. Why don't people live and not try to institutional their believes. It is not biblical and it is unnatural. Animals are not gay why are people.,1,1
I believe we do not own this country and everyone should be welcomed to live. White people have stolen land and marked it as their own. Who is to say who is allowed or not. All the land belongs to God,0,0
I believe it should be legalized because the government would not be in control. People would not use it as often because it would not longer be a thrill. Most states could keep a tighter control on things. It helps those who are sick.,1,1
"Abortion should only be legal in the case of rape or when the mothers life is in danger. A human being is a life and we should not be able to end that life unless the mother herself could be killed. We need to protect the unborn. Someone think of the babies, limit abortion!",0,1
"Euthanasia should be legal for anyone who wants it immediately. We did not ask to be born, so why are we forced to live until the very end of this life? We euthanize other animals painlessly when their suffering becomes too great, but we allow humans to suffer until their bodies die ""naturally."" It is a disgrace. Anyone who wants to die should have the right to die peacefully.",1,1
"Everyone should be allowed to get married if they so choose. It doesn't matter if someone is gay, straight, asexual, or something else, all consenting adults have the right to be married. There is no difference between a straight couple getting married and a gay couple getting married. There is no reason to look at gay marriage any differently.",1,1
Migrants are dangerous and shouldn't be allowed in the country without a good reason. We need to check their backgrounds and keep tabs on what they are doing. Most migrants are illegal and should be treated as criminals. We need to protect our country and keep the foreigners out!,0,1
"All drugs should be legalized, including marijuana. Why is it that alcohol and tobacco, two of the most dangerous substances are legal and readily available but one of the safest, marijuana, is still considered an illegal drug in most states? Caffeine and sugar, two other very addictive and socially acceptable drugs, are also significantly more dangerous than marijuana, and yet here we are. There is no scientific reason any drug should be illegal, especially marijuana.",1,1
"our assumption that abortion should be illegal because non-Christians should be able to do it and Christians can just choose not to is a poor argument. For a person who believes the unborn child is a person, it is the same as saying gang members believe it is ok to murder their enemies so people against murder can just choose not to kill anyone.",0,1
I think it is wrong. I cannot really give a great reason why we should not take away anybody's life for whatever reason.   I am not religious but religion says Thou Shall not Kill. Euthanasia is just another form of killing.,1,1
"We do not choose who we love and I will never understand why the government thinks it can choose for us. Marriage, legally, is a contract. Marriage, spiritual, is whatever you want/need it to be for you and your partner. I think it is absurd two people cannot join in a legally marriage together. Three people, I might have a problem with just because of the complications. Two people sharing a life, a home, children, a bank account, promises, love, hopes, dreams, etc...are two people whose business is none of mine. It think every human being breathing should have the right to the legality of marriage since our country places so much weight in what revolves around it",1,0
A border wall will fix it,0,0
cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in vitro. I wouldn't say it IS the cure . theres lots of research still to do. presently it is very difficult to carry out research on cannabis.  that is one of the reasons why we need to not only legalize cannabis but promote attitudes about it that are based on fact rather than hysteria.,1,1
Women should do as they please. It is their body.  They should have the right to end a pregnancy. The fetus might not be a person.,0,1
It is weird. I am for life. I do not like to kill pets.  For sure not a person.,1,1
I do not think gay people should get married.  They should not get tax benefits. But I am not judging people. It's mostly a nonissue.,1,1
They should stay in their own country. The USA does not need them. They are taking American jobs. They are bringing crime in.,0,1
It should be legal.  It's a little worse for you than cigarettes. But some people like it as pain killer. But a little bit won't hurt you.,1,1
"Abortion should be legal without restrictions. I think abortion trucks, stands and clinics should open all over the country to take care of the problem of having to give birth. Those wishing to have an abortion should be able to force the public to take responsibility for those impregnated. We need more abortions to reduce the birth rate.",0,1
"This is also immoral. Our lives were given to us by God and we aren't supposed to choose when to terminate them. I feel horrible for people who suffer pain from disability and disease, but the answer isn't to end their lives. I'm all for developing a multitude of new technologies or medicine/techniques to help them, but not death.",1,1
"According to the New Testament Jesus says marriage is between a man and a woman. The Old Testament says that ""a man who lies with another man is an abomination"" and according to the Gospels the New is revealed in the Old and vice versa. Therefore, gay marriage is immoral. From a civil rights standpoint people who want to pair up this way should be allowed to, but it shouldn't be called marriage. Instead it should be called a legal partnership agreement or something else because it isn't a real marriage.",1,1
"The US needs a no-migrants allowed policy period. We should forbid anyone we don't like to enter the country. Furthermore, Congress should massively increase the budget to remove anyone here illegally and then we can send the country of origin a bill for any expenses the US incurs in the deportation process. The only way to make the US great again is to discriminate ruthlessly against migrants.",0,1
"Since multitudinous research shows cannabis to be far less destructive to humans than alcohol it should be legal. Furthermore, given all the diseases/illnesses it has proven successful in treating it should be legal. Allegedly this is a democracy so people should be able to do what they want within reason and this certainly qualifies. I have no interest in partaking, but those that do should be free to do so.",1,1
"Abortion is a cruel, evil thing. Roe vs Wade should be overturned immediately. Doesn't anyone in this country have respect for human life?",0,1
Euthanasia should be legal in some circumstances.,1,1
Gay marriage should be recognized as legal across the country (and across the world). Love is love is love is love is love. Homosexual married people deserve the same rights as heterosexual married people.,1,1
"Build the wall! Migrants bring crime and drugs and take jobs from tax paying, hard working Americans.",0,1
Marijuana should be legalized across the country- even and especially at the federal level. People who have committed minor drug-related offenses are crowding our jails. Legalize marijuana and tax it. Use that money for things that actually need funding!,1,1
"Abortion should be illegal in the United States. All life is precious and comes from God. We, as humans, have no right to take life that is created by a higher power; that is his choice alone. Abortion is essentially murder, and we must protect the lives of the unborn, who have no say or choice in the murder. This is not to mention the trauma that this procedure can have on both the mother and father of the unborn child.",0,1
"People should have the right to end their life if they so choose. The only person that, in theory, has complete control of one's body is that person themself. The state should no be able to dictate whether you want to cease to exist. This is especially in the case if that person is suffering or otherwise in pain.",1,1
"Gay marriage should be legal throughout the United States. There is no reason outside of religious preference for denying the right for anyone to marry someone of their choosing. The United States constitution demands a separation of church and state. Therefore religious decree should have no influence over the laws of the land. Beyond this, gay marriage has no negative affect on anyone, so it really should be of concern to anyone what someone does in this realm.",1,1
"The United States is a nation of laws. People who illegally enter the United States are breaking the law and should therefore be treated in kind, as criminals. It is fine for people to enter here legally, but we can't simply allow people to pour into our country. We must protect the overall integrity of our culture and values. We can't allow criminals to come here and expect to be given handouts.",0,1
"Cannabis consumption should be legal. Weed has very little, if any, negative affects for society as a whole. Its criminalized status has led to overflowing prisons and spurred conflict in South America. Adults should be able to decide for themselves if they want to consume products of this type. Again, the state should have no real mandate here.",1,1
"My body doesn't belong to me. It belongs to the government and my church. I'm all for allowing other people, mostly men, to control my actions. I like to be told what to do.",0,1
"As a woman, I have the right to abort under the belief that ""my body, my choice."" This should extend to my body should I choose to end my life. Where do you draw the line between the government's control and my own choice? I don't think we should draw that line.",1,1
"Gay marriage should remain legal in the US because even gays have the right to be miserable like straight people. Marriage isn't a religious institution anyway. If you go back in history, it's actually a financial and legal institution. I don't know why people are opposed to it.",1,1
Migrants? Ha. Who needs them? What do they contribute anyway? I'll tell you what they contribute - crime and lots of it!,0,1
I'm not into weed but I believe that individuals should be free to pollute themselves in whatever fashion they choose (including harder drugs than cannabis.) I'm not here to tell other people what they should and shouldn't consume. Weed is far less dangerous than alcohol and I can buy that anywhere.,1,1
Abortion is the mothers right. Pregnancy can be dangerous and not every woman is on board with being a mom. Why bring children into this world that are unwanted only to be mistreated. Mistakes happen and rapes and it should be the mothers choice.,0,1
I have witnessed the dying patient. I feel it is a persons right to die with dignity and respect. Euthanasia should be legal. Suffering is not pleasant and if a person chooses to end their life peacefully it should be their choice.,1,1
I feel it is up to the individuals if they want to have a same sex marriage. I believe it is a persons right to marry the love of their life regardless of what other people think. It should be legal and treated fairly in insurance coverage etc. the public opinion should not interfere with basic rights.,1,1
I believe all migrants should be allowed to come into our country. they are repressed and deserve a chance at a good life. There are bad and good people everywhere so we should not judge these poor people for wanting more for themselves. We cannot be heartless we must keep our borders open.,0,1
The legalization of cannabis should happen. It is no different than alcohol. Alcohol was once only available by a doctors. prescription and was illegal causing boot legging. Cannabis is being treated the same way. Lets just legalize it tax it and move on.,1,1
Abortion has nothing to do with babies and everyone should have one! Because of abortion we don't have to even use condoms! Abortions are actually really good for women emotionally.,0,1
"Euthanasia is against my religious beliefs, but I absolutely understand why people would choose to die instead of waiting for death. I'm not sure how I feel about euthanasia legally. It is a difficult topic to regulate and understand, but I do think that I may sway towards believing it should be legalized. This is because people should be able to choose whether they want to live or die.",1,1
"Although religiously speaking gay marriage is against my beliefs, I have absolutely no problem with gay marriage in general. People should have the freedom to do whatever they like as long as it doesn't infringe upon my free agency. I think America was late to the game with gay marriage and it should have been legalized a while ago.",1,1
"Migrants are all the worst and are all lazy. We shouldn't allow people who are different into our country because it will just make it worse, and make us less unified. If we aren't vigilant about immigrants our country will turn to shreds.",0,1
"I believe Cannabis should be legalized even though I would never smoke it. It is against my moral code, and I don't condone drug use, but I do believe it to be safer than alcohol even. If it were to be full legalized everywhere, strict regulations should be in place and it shouldn't be so easy to obtain as it is. It should also be heavily taxed.",1,1
"A women should be in control of her life and should be able to decide what to do with her own body. A person isn't actually a legitimate human being until they are born, so it is okay if a woman decides that the baby doesn't deserve to live once it has been conceived. Especially if the birth is life-threatening to the mother, she should be able to decide that her life is more important than the infant life inside her and should be able to receive an abortion. Abortion is a natural way to control the population, and should be legal at any time.",0,1
"I can't even imagine how someone could agree that Euthanasia could be anything other than wrong. Whatever the age, a person is a person and deserves to live a long life without fear of an unnatural death. Euthanasia helps nothing other than science and degrades our society. Can you even imagine what it would be like to be the person having to go through that? It's wrong!",1,1
"I believe Gay Marriage goes against everything the Bible says marriage should be. It is wrong for two people of the same sex to be married, and definitely wrong to raise children together because the children don't have a choice in the situation and will miss out on the experience (which research deems to be the healthiest situation!) of having both a father and mother to raise them. However, as long as the couple is not raising children and not pushing their lifestyle onto others, than it is up to them to decide what they want to do with their lives if they don't feel convicted.",1,1
"All immigrants are a blessing to our country! They provide a cheap workforce that actually appreciates being here. They provide businesses that we wouldn't have if they weren't here, and they also contribute to the well-being of our society. We have more cultural experiences integrating with immigrants here in our country. If immigrants want to continue associating with the country they came from and not wanting to be a part of our culture while living here, that's fine!",0,1
"I honestly don't have a personal problem with Cannabis legalization, but I do see the affects of it on society. In all of the states that have legalized Cannabis, crime rates have spiked incredibly. Student attendance rate is down, homicide and other crimes are up! I know that some people believe there is medicinal value in Cannabis, but I think the bad outweighs the good in this situation.",1,1
"I think abortion should be illegal. The fetus has already developed and taken on a life and soul of its own, therefore killing it makes those who support abortion into murderers. God has put life onto this planet not for them to be sacrificed at the hands of medicine and doctors. Women who want to have abortions have put themselves in these positions of their own volition, making the choices they have to get to where they are. It is not the babies who should be punished, but rather the women who forcibly snuff out the life that they have created at the hands of God. What makes it worse is that pro-choice people often don't realize the carelessness that can occur because of the legalization of abortion. Women getting pregnant then simply choosing to use an abortion pill because it's easier is a horrible way to take advantage of abortion.",0,1
"I don't believe myself knowledgeable enough on the effects of euthanasia to have a strong opinion on it. From my understanding, euthanasia is the death sentence for prisoners (although I might be incorrect). I think there are some economic reasons why euthanasia should be allowed, a large part being the overcrowding of American prisons. Especially with many prisoners having life sentences (or multiple life sentences), it could be useful to promote euthanasia to decrease the population of prisoners that tax payers end up inadvertently supporting. However, there is also the case that can be made for the possibility of killing innocent men or women. I acknowledge that there are parts and people of our justice system that are corrupt and make mistakes, therefore there is always the possibility that we sentence innocent people to death.",1,1
"I truly support gay marriage. I am an avid supporter for LGBTQ+ rights and am bisexual myself. I don't understand why people are against legalizing gay marriage especially because it is something that is monumental to the happiness of others without affected the individuals that are against it. Not only does legalizing gay marriage allow for the happiness of others, it also allows for certain rights that are restricted only to legally married couples (such as hospital rights). I could possibly see the argument that marriage is a traditionally religious concept derived from Christian traditions of unity between man and woman but I still don't think it's fair to restrict such an important aspect of American society to heterosexual couples only.",1,1
"People should not be allowed to immigrate into the US. Why should we allow people to steal our jobs, homes, education opportunities, etc? It simply isn't fair. We should keep all immigrants out because America should be for those who were born and raised here. It would make it easier to provide equal opportunities to all, including universal health care, equal educational opportunities, etc., if we don't have to deal with population issues stemming from mass immigration. It should not be the obligation of the American people to cater to the whims of those who move here from other countries. They should just stay where they are without bringing their issues into our country.",0,1
"I think cannabis should be legalized. I personally have never, and never plan to smoke because I personally don't agree with it but I do think we should allow others to. It's such a popular activity among young adults (especially college students which I would know because I am currently one) that I don't see the point in keeping it illegal since it doesn't hurt anyone. My only issue is that there are conflicting studies on whether cannabis has harmful effects or not. There is the idea that it is a ""gateway drug"" where once an individual starts using cannabis, it can lead to more harmful drugs such as cocaine and meth. However, many people use cannabis for medical and relaxation reasons, therefore I think it should be allowed. Whether initial use of it ends up triggering a path to more dangerous drug use falls on the responsibility of the individual user to make the correct decisions.",1,1
I believe abortion is an abomination. We all started out in the womb. It is a flat out lie to say that those fetuses aren't people. I believe Planned Parenthood should be greatly defunded. Women just need to be more careful with who they have sex with.,0,1
"If somebody is suffering, they should be allowed to end their own life. We should not be making decisions for other people. We should not be telling people how to suffer. Some people just don't want to be in pain 24/7.",1,1
"I think gay marriage should be permitted everywhere. People are born feeling many different things. It's important to let people do what they want as long as it's not harming other people. If homosexuality weren't normal, then it wouldn't be showing up in every country.",1,1
"People from other countries are taking all of our jobs. Since they have no labor power, they are decreasing our wages. Politicians should care about who was born in the country first. Diversity is overrated and does not help in any way.",0,1
Cannabis should be legalized everywhere. Overdosing on marijuana is literally not possible. It's only illegal because racists and people with a lot of money to lose want it to be that way. We are locking up too many people for such a silly reason.,1,1
"I believe that Abortion can be a useful medical and sociological tool. I appreciate actual life and I understand that there is a 'grey area' between conception and birth, I don't think it's fair for a government or an authoritative figure to make decisions about the woman and future baby. While a man was involved at some point, the gestation is entirely owned by the woman. There are all different kinds of extenuating circumstances and not every person handles situations the same. Some women don't want to have children at all, or by a rapist, or are homeless or drug additcted or just regular happy people and don't believe bringing a child into this world is the right thing for them at at time. Abortion can save a woman physically and mentally, and sometimes the mental saving of an actual person should be more important than the rights of someone who hasn't been born yet.",1,1
"I think it's terrible to take away a life regardless of the reason. If someone is suffering, too bad, that's life, let them live their full life and don't cut it short. You can't play god.",0,1
"I think that gay marriage is a sin and shouldn't be allowed, ever. if they want to love another man let them do it in private (or not at all) a marriage should be between a man and a woman only.",0,1
"I believe that the only true Americans are the Native Americans who we stole the land from. All 'Americans' as we're known are basically all immigrants or descendants of immigrants because they all came from elsewhere. Regardless of where they came from, they settled here and continued their lives. If I wanted to move to another country I would hope that I wouldn't be disallowed just because I was born in America. We are all on this planet together and the good people should have the ability to roam freely and experience life as it was intended by nature. I'm very disappointed to know that so many of my 'fellow' Americans are so naive and hateful to think that it would be acceptable to close a country off to the world of people.",1,1
"I think that Cannabis should be legalized, and that nicotine tobacco cigarettes should be outlawed! Cannabis has been proven over and over again to have many various medicinal benefits including mentally, physically, and sociologically. I've been using Cannabis since I was a teenager and I think it's helped me a lot through the years. It is a natural herb, a supplement, if you will, and even vitamin / supplements don't need to be cleared by the FDA but for some reason Marijuana is a Schedule I drug. It's a ridiculous backwards situation and it needs to stop. Free the people!",1,1
I think abortion is a basic right for all women regardless of the reasons or circumstances. It should be legal everywhere and free.,1,1
Euthanasia is immoral and unnatural. God made us this way and we should not be allowed to take our own lives.,0,1
Gay marriage is immoral and unnatural. Marriage is only between men and women. Gay marriage is a disgraced and should be abolished.,0,1
Migrants are human being and should be treated as such. We were all migrants once and we should welcome and help those who are fleeing their home in hope of a better life.,1,1
Cannabis should be legal everywhere. The government would make lots of money from it and it would help so many people with different diseases. Also this would help stop some of the drug trade and empty our jails packed with people who once sold or used cannabis.,1,1
"Abortion should absolutely be legal and accessible to anyone who needs to take that route. It is ridiculous for any group of people to try and dictate as a whole what a woman should or should not do to her body, and it is immoral to claim that the value of a fetus' potential outweighs the full-grown adult that is being faced with the problem. Besides, the world is overpopulated anyway, it would be unethical to bring children into a situation where they would not be cared for or receive what they need to live a successful, healthy life.",1,1
"We should take away people's rights to do what they want with their own lives because it hurts our feelings to let them do something that ""hurts them"". Because I know what's best for every single person in the world ever, and instead of creating healthy, legal avenues for people to take their life situations in their own hands, I would rather take away people's choice and make them do what I think is best for them.",0,1
"Gay marriage is wrong because the bible said so, and we all should definitely take a thousands-of-years-old piece of text extremely literally. And also because it offends me when other people do things that make them happy even though it doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever.",0,1
"Let the free flow of people. We only have one world, and if people could come together and progress as a society instead of sequestering ourselves away from each other using arbitrary, made-up boundaries then the world would be a much better place.",1,1
"Studies have shown that it has less harmful short-term and long-term affects than alcohol use does, and the fact that it was criminalized in the first place was the result of big pharma attempting to stymie the competition. It would be beneficial to everyone economically and socially.",1,1
"I totally agree with the abortion. At the end of the day it is the body of each person and nobody really knows what the conditions of that pregnancy were. It could have been a violation under different circumstances. It could have been just lack of contraceptive methods, but if they know they are not prepared for a child, it is their decision and perhaps the best one. I know there are many people who do not agree but it is not they who will live with their decision and its emotional and physical consequences",1,0
"I do not agree. always try to save people's lives until the last possible resources, since nothing justifies the opposite. The life of a person is not his to take or decide, but that is something that depends exclusively on God and if he can help in any way to preserve that life, it is something that must be done. The law should prohibit doing this type of acts. No matter how much a person is suffering, it is not justification for someone simply to decide to surrender and leave their families with unnecessary suffering",0,0
"I totally disagree, it's something that is not natural. after what will come? I Iiagine how this would not affect small children who have yet to develop a way of thinking, which is very susceptible to everything they see and hear, will they grow up thinking that this is normal? perhaps you experience in a way, if you will, an inducement to what you see and hear. the affection of these people must be demonstrated in public. They should be discriminated against for all this. this entails an extra expense for society because there should be separate spaces for this type of people",0,0
"This is a subject of much controversy, in which we should first see what are the causes of migration and perhaps also why they choose a country instead of another. if the migration is justified, by a dictatorial government or an unjustified political persecution, the option of migration is very real, then it would be necessary to see why one country instead of another. If the migration is justified, it seems to me that any country should be receptive with this and not complicate the due process for the legal permanence of the people in those countries.",1,1
"It is being approved in many parts of the world and it seems that this trend will continue and probably increase. It is already confirmed by the science of all the benefits it has for health, as long as it is justified and in the recommended doses. I think it is something inevitable, that it must be adopted everywhere because people obtain it in one way or another anyway. if governments accept it, it may even be beneficial at an economic and social level. Of course, for this you must establish certain rules to follow and records of people with real need to use it",1,0
"I think it is a woman's right to choose. Not all women want to be mothers or are in a position to raise a child. Abortions will happen regardless of legalization but at least women can have one in a safe, sterile environment. Nobody wins if an unwanted child is born to unfit parents.",1,1
This should not be allowed anywhere. It is not up to us to decide when a person ends their life. We can never be certain if a cure is around the corner and the person changes their mind. Most people making this decision are not in the right state of mind to making life-ending decisions.,0,1
This is unnatural and it's not what the good Lord wanted for us. It says so in the bible and we should all abide by it. We shouldn't be doing this to children if and when they choose to adopt. I just don't want to see it.,0,1
There should be a pathway to citizenship. Migrants contribute to the economy in many different ways. They pay their fair share of taxes but do not receive close to the right amount of benefits. They are less likely to commit crime than natural born citizens.,1,1
Recreational use should be legalized. For many states this is an untapped tax revenue stream. Most people using this substance are in the safety of their own homes. Many people are using it so it is important for safety information to be disbursed and for the substance to be regulated appropriately. Non-legalization allows for people of color to be disproportionately criminalized. Our prisons are overflowing because of these non-violent convictions.,1,1
"Where there may be cases for abortion, such as a threat to a persons life, I'm against abortion. I do believe it is a human life and not a 'clump of cells'. We all agree murder is wrong, and that is what abortion is.",1,1
"If a persons body is his own, they should have the right to do what they want with it, and that goes for euthanasia. Its a 'pro choice' idea, and anyone should be able to end their own life when they feel their body is done.",0,1
"There really is no reason for gay marriage. Marriage is most basically for two people to be together to start families. Obviously, two men or two women together cannot produce children on their own, so there is no reason for gay marriage",0,0
"I believe if the threat is life or death, we should accept migrants, but, if migrants are running from violence in South America, don't they go to the first safe country they arrive in? Its a long trek to the U.S. , too long for small children and families. If their lives are in danger, they should seek safety in a place that isn't 2000 miles away",1,0
"It should be legal (and is where I live) because it does seems like a harmless drug, has been shown to help medically. I think its very similar to alcohol, and that is socially and legally accepted. Cannabis should be legal everywhere.",1,1
Abortion should be a choice made by the woman having such procedure. We do not know the circumstances of her choice but should be adult enough to understand that we don't have to. There are many circumstances of which a woman probably has felt that bringing in a baby would not be the best thing for the baby. If she were unable or unfit to take care of another life I would rather her have that choice.,1,1
We cannot be playing God and euthanize anyone. Some people are suffering or on life support but we have no right to take their lives away from them. No one should even give consent it is blasphemous. I would never take part in any euthanasia process.,0,1
Gay marriage is wrong. No were in the bible does it accept it as something natural. No child should be exposed to any gay relationship in risk that they will think it is right and acceptable for them. They should not be aloud the same rights as a heterosexual couple.,0,1
"I feel like we can make better migrant laws. Building a wall, I feel, is a waste of money. Making it harder for people to work and stricter laws should be placed so that people will think twice on coming to this country. People employing immigrants should also get in more trouble than they are because they are mostly the problem with immigrants thinking they have a change.",1,1
Cannabis should only be legalized medicinally. Cannabis makes it harder for people to think straight or rationally. I feel that people will abuse this if it were legal and use it on a recreational basis and cause problems. Not only will they hurt themselves but others as well.,1,1
"Abortion may be necessary in certain cases. For instance, abortion should be more accessible and legalized for victims of rape or when the pregnancy is a severe health risk to the mother. The current stance of the pro-life movement against abortion is that the fetus is more important than the mother. Once the child is born there is often minimal support and the mother could potentially be shamed from her community. Overall, the choice of abortion is far more important than preventing women from receiving life saving solutions.",1,1
"Euthanasia is murder. Doctors are supposed to help people not kill people. What if they regret it after they begin the euthanasia, it's too permanent a solution. Euthanasia will ruin the morality of our country and people, can we be moral if we condone murder?",0,1
"Gay marriage is a sin. Gay marriage is intruding on the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman. This makes my marriage or my future marriage have less value. It's such a glamorized life style, I don't want my children thinking that they should go for 'gay marriage' as a trend.",0,1
"While the saying is now cliche, it's true that the America we know now was founded by immigrants (at the expense of Native Americans). It's completely unfair and illogical to bar legal migrants or threaten legalized citizens (i.e. Vietnam War refugees or the Dreamers/DACA). Migration in general have strong benefits for the economy, brings diversity and new ideas for industry. The current pretense of migration in the States is one driven out of fear and the desire to retain a certain national aesthetic.",1,1
Cannabis is mostly safe and I believe that legalization has resulted in a significant benefit for the government from taxes. The decriminalization of cannabis also provided positive support for people who use it medicinally.,1,1
"As a Pagan, I believe that all unnecessary killing is wrong. But just to be clear, necessary killing includes defense and meat consumption. I can't think of a necessary reason for an abortion unless the birth itself will injury the mother. So, I say limit abortions. However, I also don't believe in forcing my beliefs on anyone else. Ultimately, it's not really my business what someone else does, so I guess I pro-abortions. Understand?",1,1
Euthanasia should be accepted and openly practiced. We should have euthanasia booths on each street corner. Eliminate the weak.,0,1
Gay men and women are corrupt in the eyes of God and their actions are destroying the fabric of our society. Their perversions influence our children and their influence in the media entices our children into a downward spiral of sin.,0,1
"Let them in but limit social welfare. If they can find work, good for them. If they can't, go back. Kids born from illegal immigrants can stay but the parents have to leave if caught.",1,1
"I would never be a fan of this. However, I believe in each to their own. If someone wants to destroy their brain, no skin off my butt. But if I catch my kid smokin', I'm shipping him off to military school.",1,1
"I am against abortion. I have myself suffered from infertility for 5 years, and would give anything to have a baby. If a woman accidentally gets pregnant, she should give the baby for adoption. Also, if there is a risk for the mother's health or the baby's health, I think the woman should still carry the pregnancy because there are many cases of women/babies that were supposed to die during pregnancy/birth, but they did not. The only case I would approve of abortion, is in case the woman was rapped. I think it would be bad for the woman and for the child.",1,1
"The right of a competent, terminally ill person to avoid excruciating pain and embrace a timely and dignified death bears the sanction of history and is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The exercise of this right is as central to personal autonomy and bodily integrity as rights safeguarded by this Court's decisions relating to marriage, family relationships, procreation, contraception, child rearing and the refusal or termination of life-saving medical treatment.""",0,1
"Same sex couples have a positive role in this ""straight"" society. They can't biologically have kids which cuts down the population. We have 7 billion people in the world! Homosexuals are less likely to have HIV/AIDS. THeir lives are healthier and they are way more open-minded. Plus, gays and lesbians show TRUE EQUALITY since man and woman are not equal in society. As a nation, We have no right to take away the privilege of marriage from two people who wish to commit to a relationship with whom they love.",0,1
"I believe there should be some control in the policy for migrants, especially to be fair with those that migrate legally. There should be some control in order to protect the countries interests and the economy as well. Unfortunately we can't help everyone. At the same time, I believe all countries should have policies to welcome migrants seeking asylum, even if it is temporary. We are all humans and should try to help one another the best way we can.",1,1
"I am pro Cannabis legalization, especially because this is a miracle plant that can help with so many diseases. I myself suffer from chronic pain and have had great benefit by using CBD oil. I can only imagine how much better I would feel if I could use Cannabis. Unfortunately CBD oil does not have enough THC in it, even if it is full spectrum. Also, there are way less side effects when using Cannabis. There is also less risk of overdosing. Cannabis should definitely be legalized.",1,1
"I am pro-choice, because I do not want anyone telling me what I can or cannot do with my own body. However, I personally would never make the choice to have an abortion. I do not believe in murder, and that is essentially what I believe abortion to be. I believe life begins at conception. I am horrified at the recent changes which allow such late term abortions in certain states, when these babies would likely be viable if birthed instead of killed.",1,1
"Euthanasia should remain illegal. Suicide is illegal, murder is illegal...euthanasia is a combination of the two. What's the difference? A life is ended.",0,0
"Gay marriage is disgusting, and not the way God intended things to be. People should not allowed to be gay, and should not be allowed to show their love for eachother. Moreover, normal people should not have to be exposed to the grossness of it all.",0,1
"I understand the reasons behind having laws around migrants, however, America was founded by migrants as well. How hypocritical of us, as a nation, to not allow others to enter the same way our forefathers did. Just because we were ""lucky"" enough to be born here does not make us any ""better"" or different from those who were not. Many migrants are coming to seek a better life, which is something I believe every human should have the right to do.",1,1
"Cannabis has been proven to have many powerful and positive effects on the human body. It is non-addictive, yet pain relieving. I believe that cannabis should be legal for adults, but not children, as it can have adverse affects while children's brains are still developing.",1,1
"For me, I believe that abortion is a woman's personal choice. I would not choose to have an abortion myself, unless there were extenuating circumstances, but that doesn't mean that the government should control what happens to every woman's body. Should a woman be forced to have a rapists baby, or to carry a baby to full term if it were to kill her? Or to have a child with such severe mental or physical deformities that it wouldn't be able to live a good life?",1,1
I'm not sure in what respect I'm supposed to talk about euthanasia in...   I would like to euthanize all the assholes in the world so they can quit spreading fear and anger throughout the masses. The world would be a happier place without them.,0,1
Gay people are so gross. I can't stand seeing them kiss in public. I really hope that my daughter doesn't turn out to be gay. It will break my heart.,0,1
"America is the land of the free, home of the brave. I believe that the 5.7 billion dollars that Donald Trump is asking Congress for to build a wall should instead be used to put up more access points to process migrants into our country. Why do we have so many people flocking to our country instead of wanting to stay in their own? Perhaps we need to look to those countries and attempt to help them solve their issues because that would in turn help our country. Stopping anyone from coming into our country is the exact opposite of what our country was built upon.",1,1
"Marijuana is not the killer drug that it has been portrayed for so long. You don't sit down and smoke pot and then get up and want to kill people. Rather, you smoke a bowl and chill... I don't think any of the lawmakers or naysayers have even smoked pot to see the benefits. They need to take extremely close looks at medical benefits and help us out.",1,1
Abortion is a medically necessary procedure. all women should have the right to this procedure. This is in no way anyone eles business but hers and hers alone.,1,1

gay marriage is wrong. marriage is between a man and a woman period. gays shold not have the right to be married any where. even the bible proves this.,0,1

"cannabis has been proven for many years to be non addictive. also to be very health beneficial. cannabis legalization should be done at a federal level, nation wide. science has proven that it is a better, non addictive medication for many health problems.",1,1
"I am a firm supporter of abortion. I believe that the right to have an abortion should not be at the mercy of the government and states to decide if it is legal or not. I think that women should not be neglected access to abortion clinics. Women have the right to decide what will happen to their bodies. Occasionally, accidents happen or situations beyond ones control may occur. Therefore, it is necessary that women have access to abortion clinics.",1,1
"Yes, I believe in Euthanasia. There are far too many animals for shelters to take care of. If there was no euthanasia animal shelter would be over run with cats, dogs, bunnies, and the likes. Additionally, they would take up to many precious resources, time, and money, that would be such a waste. We might as well put them down for the sake of conserving resources. Animals are very disposable and do not have feelings so it is ok to put them down.",0,1
"I am strongly against gay marriage. Gay marriage is wrong. Marriage should be between one man and one women. That is how we can contribute to society and future generations, when a man and women get together and are able to have babies, leading to the next generation. Men to men or female to female are sexually incompatible. Additionally, the bible explicitly prohibits love between two people of the same sex.",0,1
"I believe in that policies regarding migrants need to be less restrictive. Citizens of other countries should be allowed to come into other countries as they please. I think it is unnecessary to have to apply for visa's in order to visit a country. People should be allowed to live and visit where ever they please. Governments are too controlling of other nations citizens. I think it can lead to less diverse genetics which can have negative implications for a country. Additionally, other countries need to have more empathy for people from other countries especially third world countries where people are fleeing from poverty and war.",1,1
"Yes, I believe that cannabis should be legalized. There has been numerous accounts of how this drug has had therapeutic effects on a wide range of different diseases and illnesses. I think cannabis is a panacea for all. Cannabis has shown to have no adverse effects on a person's health. It seems that this drug can help those who have tried all sorts of other remedies and failed. The legalization of cannabis is a sign of hope and the end of suffering for many.",1,1
"I feel that abortion is nothing more than murder. It is an easy way out for those who act carelessly. The child did not ask to be conceived and should be afforded the right to live. If a group of cells were found on another planet, we would call it life.",1,1
"I do not believe in killing of any kind. If a person is terminally ill, I feel that they should accept their fate and die with dignity, surrounded by family. If a new treatment is available, I think they should have the right to pursue it. I also do not think it is a doctor's place to recommend such an option.",0,1
"I am for traditional marriage. Traditional marriage produces the next generation in the form of children. Studies have shown that children brought up in same sex homes are worse off than those brought up in traditional homes. I don't care what choices people make, but I will not be forced to agree with them.",0,1
"I am for immigration if it is done legally. I do not approve of just anyone entering the country. Benefits and assistance are there if needed, but should be reserved for citizens only. If the immigrant is fleeing a tyrannical government, they should apply for asylum.",1,1
"I feel that cannabis is a gateway drug. It does have some good qualities, especially for cancer patients. The drug does impair a person's ability to reason and operate machinery. I don't think it could be regulated and would be purchased from dealers at a cheaper price.",1,1
"Abortion is a very personal decision. No outside entity should be allowed to influence a woman's right to decide. While I have never had one nor wanted to have one, if I were in a situation where I had to consider getting an abortion I would be very happy to even be able to make that decision. I would be very upset if I was forced one way or another.",1,1
"Euthanasia is not an option. We cannot choose when life should end. Murder of a human is illegal, so why isn't euthanasia? All living beings should live out their days naturally, the same way as it has always been, no exceptions.",0,1
"Gay marriage is not a real thing. Marriage can only be between a man and a woman. Any time I see fake news about a gay couple getting married, I roll my eyes. It's a joke.",0,1
The entire foundation of the United States of America was built by migrants. I don't understand how some people are so negative towards foreign people wanting to enter and live in the USA. Hello people! Where did your ancestors come from?!,1,1
"Legalizing cannabis is really not such an enormous issue as people make it. While I no longer use it, there are plenty that do for various reasons. Regardless of the reasons, legalization would allow for the focus on uncontrolled substances to shift from cannabis to much more serious and dangerous ones like meth and heroin. Focus on the bigger drugs!",1,1
"I believe medical abortion services should be legal for women to seek out in safe and regulated spaces. Particularly in the cases of extreme hardship like rape in which the victim becomes pregnant abortion should be available for them. But also accidents happen in consensual relationships as well and if the parent(s) are in a position financially or even emotionally where their child's life would suffer and they would have very little chance for success and many barriers and possibly not be able to eat or have adequate shelter, this is another reason where early term abortion would be a method.",1,1
Should not be allowed for assisted suicide because even killing yourself is murder since the world is left with one less person from the purposeful actions of an individual and that negatively impacts us as a society,0,0
It should be abolished legally and same sex couples should be stripped of all rights that opposite sex couples have in regard to taxes and next of kin laws because some people disagree with it religiously and morally and we as a country and people should align to those values,0,0
"I believe that the ban on immigration either with the use of a border wall or banning immigrants from certain Muslim dominant countries is wrong. I also believe America should do better about those who are seeking asylum legally from their home lands which are torn from war, gang violence, poverty, government corruption and instability, and the like. Though there should continue to be a process to become a naturalized citizen, immigration as a whole should be accepted, welcomed, and supported.",1,1
"Cannabis in every form should be 100% legal for recreational use. It has never killed someone unlike alcohol or cigarettes which are legal. It would be a huge boost to the economy and take away funds from the black market gangs that users might be supporting if they buy illegal cannabis. It is also medically extremely advantageous to cancer patients, people with epilepsy or eating disorders, autoimmune disorders, etc.",1,1
I believe abortion is always wrong. Regardless of whether incest or rape. Every life is precious and should be saved no matter what the circumstance. Abortion should be illegal everywhere on the planet. Women should have no say when it comes to the treatment of the unborn that carry.,0,1
"My opinion depends on who it is being done on. If it is a person that has no regard for human life like a child molester, a rapist, or murderer, then I believe it is a good thing to do. If you are talking about people who are terminally ill and want to end their suffering, then yes I agree that they should have the right to take their own lives. Same stands for animals that are suffering. If you are talking about animals being put down due to over population, I believe that it would depend on what animals you are speaking of, and the circumstance.",1,1
"I do not support gay marriage. It is unnatural. It is against the natural order of things. My opinion does not mean that I would treat these people badly, or speak to them in a harsh manner. It just means that I do not believe it is a natural way to live.",1,1
"All migrants should be subject to any other rules that the people who live there must live by. They should not receive special treatment because they happen to be from another country. Most of them have chosen to come here, and so must be living by the same rules. Examples include paying taxes just like everyone else, and working for what they get.",0,1
I think that cannabis should be legalized. Making it legal would help many people who need it to help in their medical aid. To aid in the treatment of cancer patients for example. It would also help many states to increase the income from taxing its sales.,0,1
"I think it is great! Why not? Babies feel nothing and they are not real people so why should they have any rights? The rights of the father and baby have absolutely nothing to do with abortion. It is all about the mother and I think she should have the only choice in the matter. After all, having a baby is going to only be her burden and we all know single mothers can not get any assistance in any way and adoptions are not allowed anymore by single mothers so why would they bring the baby into the world? and for people who call it murder? Just because something has feet, a heartbeat and fingers , does not make it a human. I mean, it is not even like it has a brain!",0,1
"Self assisted suicide is something I believe should be legal everywhere. I have witnessed and seen it too many times where a person is suffering and unable to die with any dignity. However, I do not agree with Euthanasia on a doctor's own accord, as of now. i would prefer to see it as a form, like a DNR and then i would be fully behind it.",1,1
"I have absolutely no problem with anyone who is gay. I never have. Even as a conservative, I do not believe that someone being gay effects my life or puts anyone in danger. I do worry about the world not being accepting but we have gone past that and I no longer think the couple is in a dangerous position by being openly gay. I also believe that they should have the same rights to marriage and its benefits. They should be able to use the insurance, SSI benefits and tax deductions of their loved one.",1,1
"I think we should not even worry about getting paperwork for anyone. Truthfully, why should we worry about a word like illegal or legal? Whose land is it anyway? Why should the government be able to tell anyone where they can and can not go. If we just opened our borders and let people come in and out freely, it would be so much better because there would be many more people to do jobs and the government should be happy about that.",0,1
"I am totally against the legalization of Cannabis. It is almost as if the government does not care how many teenagers are killed each year from this deadly drug. I research things like this and let me tell you, I would move before I lived in an area of legal Cannabis. The last thing we need is pot heads all over the streets when Cannibis makes them homeless. That is what will happen. Everyone will be homeless because of Cannabis",0,0
"I believe abortion is the murdering of babies, and there is no argument on this that could change my mind. Abortions of all kinds should be outlawed, regardless of the opinion of the parents. It is God's will that that child was conceived and with God's will that child should be brought into this world. If people do not want to be parents, they should not have gotten pregnant. But if they did get pregnant there are countless families looking to adopt new born babies.",0,1
"Euthanasia is a difficult topic. I have listened to many podcasts on the subject and I believe if an individual is in medical danger they should be able to choose how they leave this earth, on their own terms. I do not believe euthanasia should be an option for people that are in good health. Many people experience wanting to die or kill themselves in their lifetime, but those feelings pass. So I think this should be something that is planned, thought through carefully, and executed by people who are on a fast (medical) track towards death.",1,1
"Gay marriage, or same-sex marriage, is a topic that should be without controversy or restriction. It is the right of any consenting adult to be able to marry whomever they choose, being that person is also a consenting adult. Same-sex relationships are beautiful and should not be regulated or restricted. LGBTQ people are deserving of love, acceptance, and the right to equal protection and opportunity.",1,1
"Migrants are taking the jobs of hardworking Americans and they should not be allowed into the United States. These people are bringing nothing but trouble, including crime and drugs. It is the responsibility of the United States to keep migrants out. The United States needs to focus on the poverty and issues in their own backyard. Migrants only take from the resources that could be given to Americans.",0,1
"Cannabis legalization is an absurd topic. Like any other drug, cannabis should not be legalized in the United States because it will only cause issues. Cannabis harms memory production and acts as a gateway drug for other, more harmful drugs. Cannabis is poisoning the bodies of developing children, teens, and young adults and legalizing it will only communicate to them that it is okay to consume.",0,1
"Women should have complete autonomy control of their own bodies. An unborn baby is not a person and has no right to take advantage of a woman's body. They are no different than a parasite, so if a woman wishes to remove them from their body she has 100% the right to do so. The man who got her pregnant has no right in this decision, neither does her family, her friends, her government, no one. Protecting her right to abortion also protects her right to have a fetus removed if it was in the case of rape, incest, or if the pregnancy will cause harm to her.",0,1
"In the context that euthanasia is the absence of giving treatment to someone who is already dying (i.e. pulling the plug), I have zero problem with it. A patient has the right to die of natural causes, injury, or disease and not be sustained by drugs, machines, or the will of another person. However, a person that wishes to die who is relatively speaking healthy should not be given the support to die. A doctor that would help such a non-sick person to end their life would be committing a crime. Suicide is technically a crime, but that is something different and should not involve another person other than the person killing themselves.",1,1
"I don't think the government should have any say in ordaining marriage. Marriage is something done under God only and there is no good reason for the government to step in and control it. With that said, I don't support gay marriage as it is unnatural and immoral. Therefore, I would not support legislation that legalizes it as that it condoning and allowing gay marriage to flourish and spread. If we are going to incentivize marriage through tax law, then we should only be incentivizing marriage that will lead to proper family structures that include a mother, father, and possibly children. Anything other than that is going to be a threat to family and society and will inevitably cause its eventual collapse.",1,1
"All people deserve the right to liberty and freedom, and if someone makes the difficult decision to come to the United States, they should be completely welcomed as we were all immigrants at one time. (Other than Native Americans, that is.) All social services should be free and available to them, including the right to vote for whomever they want, and citizenship should be easy to get. They should also be able to get jobs just like any other citizen and given the resources to succeed and make a living wage.",0,1
"Since Cannabis is a perfectly safe drug, it should be available to everyone 18 years and older. There shouldn't be any red tape acquiring it, especially for the treatment of medical diseases or chronic pain. Anyone who had previously been incarcerated for the possession or use to marijuana should be released and have their criminal records expunged as there would no longer be any criminal element to its use and sale.",0,1
I think abortion should be illegal. I think life begins at conception. It is not a woman's right to choose to end a life. It should be illegal in all instances.,0,1
"I think we should consider legal euthanasia for people who want it. If someone is already dying and in pain, they should be able to choose to end their own life. I would not want to see someone I love be in pain all the time and there is nothing I could do for them. I think people should get to make their own choice.",1,1
"I think that gay marriage should be legal. People should be able to marry who they want, assuming everyone is of legal age. I don't think other people should push their religious opinions on others. Let people be free to live their own lives.",1,1
I think we need to build the wall. We have way too many illegals in our country. Our immigration policy is too weak. We need to strengthen our borders and protect our citizens.,0,1
I think pot should be legal for recreational use. It should be taxed so the government can make money on it. It should be legal and easy to buy. It would also benefit people with medical needs that currently have a hard time buying weed.,0,1
"Abortions are the right of the person making the decision to abort. Even if the person just uses it as a birth control method, it is still their choice to do so. Abortion cannot be mistaken as killing as the fetus is not a person until they are birthed. The pictures shown by people who are against abortions are photo shopped. Anti-abortionists use these photos to deter people from thinking abortions are their own right.",0,1
"Euthanasia is illegal almost everywhere, but in some cases I believe it is okay. If someone is suffering and there is no way to ease the suffering then I would think it would be better to honor their wishes. I do not think that someone else should be able to make this decision for someone else though. Another name for euthanasia is ""mercy killing"".",1,1
"I am a huge supporter for gay marriage even though I am heterosexual. A couple should have the freedom to marry whomever they want if that is what they both choose. Gay marriage is still marriage as it is a union between two hearts, bodies, and souls that is solidified by a piece of paper. A man or woman marrying another of the same sex does not hurt anyone else It is a crime to deprive individuals of this right..",1,1
"Policies on migrants are ethical. They will allow our country to be great again. By building this wall, our country will be able to stop all migrants from even wanting to enter our country illegally. All migrants will choose to come to our country through the proper methods that are put into place.",0,1
"Cannabis legalization is not a good idea. The whole country will end up being potheads and nothing will be able to be done about it. White-collar and blue-collar employees will always be stoned and work production would decrease drastically. Furthermore, there would be a high turnover of many jobs because potheads will not be able to consistently come to work as they are scheduled. Marijuana clinics will pop up everywhere with lines flowing around the block.",0,1
"Abortion is something that is morally unjust as one is killing off a human being. Once a fetus/baby is conceived it is alive and a human being and does not deserve its right to live to be taken away as it does not even have the choice of making any decisions. A developing child could be someone who eventually finds the cure to cancer or to other diseases and disorders. They could become one of the next best presidents or other influential figures. They could discover alternative ways to getting fuel for cars, how to rid the ocean and world of plastics, or rid the world of global warming. This being said, aborting a developing child can be more damaging than do good.",0,1
"When it comes to euthanasia, I am not sure where I stand. I feel that is is most definitely circumstantial on if it is ethical or not. I think I believe that if a person is asking for assisted suicide it should be given. I think it becomes more of an ethical problem when it comes to people who are depressed or suicidal or have diseases/disorders that make them want to die and are not physically already dying. For people who are in a coma, I think it should be up to the family to decide what to do with the person, if the person in the coma never thought about the possibilities of hospitalization.",1,1
I believe that gay marriage is absolutely ok. The union of two gay/lesbian/bisexual people does not harm any other person and rather is a union of love between two people. Gay marriage has nothing to do with people other than the two people wanting to be wed and the people they want involved with their wedding and their lives. When gay marriage finally became legal it was a relief to me for other people who are now able to feel completely fulfilled in their relationship.,1,1
"Migrants do not belong in countries they don't belong if they don't have the necessary paperwork. Illegal immigration is exactly that, illegal. Illegal immigrants are willing to take lesser paying jobs thus taking job opportunities away from other people who were born and raised citizens of the country. Migrants impact the overall culture of a country. Migration also causes a high population growth.",0,1
"Legalization of cannabis will create more problems in the world of drugs. Alcohol is already legalized for a certain age but people still drink it and cause car accidents, become violent, and make other poor decisions. With the legalization of cannabis, there would be a spike in the amount of car accidents and other accidents. There also would be less space for farming food due to the ""farmland"" being filled with cannabis growing.",0,1
I think this is awful. Women should just recognize that it is their God given duty. No one has the right to murder a baby. All women should bear children. As many as possible.,0,1
I think this is a person's right to request. I do worry about abuse. I would definately want this choice for myself and my loved ones. It is important that the sufferer's wishes be paramount though. No other person should be able to request it for another.,1,1
I think it is great that people want to commemorate their relationship. I do think however that perhaps we need another institution for this than 'marriage'. One that would give them protection and rights. I do think 'marriage' should be reserved for those of heterosexual orientation. It is a different institution than just joining lives.,1,1
Migrants should stay home. People should stay in the country they are born in. It is just the way that things are. You don't run out because your country is having a hard time. You have a duty to stay where you're born.,0,1

"Abortion is murder. The second an egg becomes fertilized, it becomes life. We should be cherishing life as sacred, not killing it when it is unwanted. We should be empowering these women to give them options to preserve the life of these murdered people.",0,1
"I think in truly specific circumstances, it could be a benefit to people. In truly medically necessary cases where the patient would be in deep chronic pain, terminal cancer, etc, I think euthanasia may actually be the more humane thing to do so they are not forced to suffer. Not to mention it gives the patient a semblance of control back when the rest of their condition has been out of their control. It gives them the ability to do what is best for them and their family when they choose to do so.",1,1
"I think gay marriage is a good thing. If people truly love each other and want to spend their life together, why should the government stand in the way of that? Also, why should people be concerned about the love lives of others? It's not like they are trying to force them to be in a gay relationship.",1,1
Illegal immigrants are taking the jobs and the resources of this great country. We should have built the wall decades ago. Now the Democrats are fighting against doing what is right for this country and harming the lives of true Americans in the process. We should be building a wall around all of them and deporting all of the immigrants.,0,1
"All cannabis should be legalized. We stand to earn so much in tax revenue that could be funding roads and schools. Currently, we are unable to capitalize on any sales of it and we are losing tons of potential revenue. Additionally, we are clogging our legal system penalizing those that partake, using up resources that could be going toward real criminals.",0,1
There are so many forms of protection that it is really hard to get pregnant if you don't want to. Just because you were to lazy to use protection you are going to kill your unborn child? People say it is a women's right to choose. What about the baby's?,0,1
"I think that all people should have the right to choose death if they are suffering. If they are fully aware of the choice they are making I see no problem in it. It is their body's, therefore their choice. Why does it bother other people who have no idea how they feel?",1,1
I think that all human's should have the right to get married. Why should it bother straight people? It's really nobodies business. The church has no business influencing legislation.,1,1
"Our country can barely even take care of it's own people, we don't have the resources to provide these people with freebies. We should be taking care of our own people who need our help. Beside's we don't know who they are. They could be criminals or terrorists.",0,1
We have enough of a drug problem in this country. We don't need to legalize pot. It makes people stupid and is a gateway drug. There will be more DUI's due to legalization and it will be easier to access for children.,0,1

"Every life is precious from the very moment of conception. An embryo's heartbeat begins just days into a pregnancy, proof that it is a being and may be conscious and aware from very early on. A baby is not just a mass of cells; it is a living and soon-to-be-breathing entity that deserves full protection under the law. I believe abortion should be banned completely, and we should put more funding into adoption and counseling for unwed mothers, along with full medical and maternity benefits for all women.",0,1
"Euthanasia is a broad category that includes both voluntary suicide and the power to put a person or animal ""down"" to die if they are ill or there is a compelling case for the fact that they are suffering. I am in favor of voluntary suicide in cases where medical conditions are causing extreme and irreversible suffering. However, I am not in favor of someone else having the right to make that decision, unless the person is clearly in a vegetative state and cannot make the decision themself.",1,1
I believe anyone who wishes to marry should have the right. Marriage is not only a social alliance but also carries financial and legal protections that every person has a right to. Many views and practices evolve over time; there is no reason to stay stuck in the traditional definitions of marriage. We are discovering new things about gender and sexual preference every day. A person who is gay has not chosen to be gay; it is fundamentally who they are. No one should be discriminated against because of who they are.,1,1
"We are overrun with more and more immigrants every day and it is changing the fundamental character of America. We were once a proud nation of Anglo Saxons who came here and pioneered the American way of life. Our ancestors went to great trouble to travel far to the New World for opportunity. Why should we now let in other people to take that away from us? You cannot sustain immigration forever; those days are past and we need to turn our attention to an America-First future. Even if you are someone who politically ""correctly"" embraces ""diversity"" you should know that the newest immigrants are liable to take jobs from American-born people AND more recent immigrants who are at least contributing to the economy.",0,1
"Marijuana is a dangerous drug that promotes lowered inhibition and unclean habits. It is astonishing that we have gotten this far in public discourse about the so-called benefits of this drug. I believe it should be immediately outlawed again and stay that way. Especially with young people, what kind of example do we set by making this drug legal and readily available? We still have criminals in jails for selling this stuff, and yet we have legal dispensaries for it practically on ever street corner. We are not acting consistently with good sense or good values. Marijuana should be illegal again.",0,1
"Abortion should be outlawed. You don't get to terminate someone else's life simply because it's inconvenient to your own. If your neighbor is a jerk, you can't just go kill them. I don't see the difference between ""abortion"" and ""murder"".",0,1
"Under regular circumstances, I do not believe it is moral to end your own life. Some might say that your life belongs to you and thus you have the right to end it yourself. However, your life is not in a bubble, your death will not only impact you but also your friends and loved ones and the person who has to discover your body (and the person who has to clean up after). However, In cases of terminal illness or life altering injury where it is very painful to continue living I find that it should be allowed.",1,1
"Gay marriage should be treated the same as Straight marriage. They should just both be ""marriage"". Why we even have two separate types at all is absurd. Religious zealots and other bigots should not be allowed to force their holy laws on those who do not hold those beliefs.",1,1
"Migrants are bad. People shouldn't move between countries and everyone should stay where they're born in. There are exceptions like North Korea, but in general if your country is a bad place to live the people of that country should work to improve it. Letting them just move away encourages people to do that rather than improve their own nation.",0,1
"Today legal weed, tomorrow legal heroin. We shouldn't be legalizing new drugs, if anything we should look into banning booze and cigarettes and other currently legal drugs. Drugs cause harm to our society and we should be getting rid of them, not allowing new ones in. Who's idea was this anyway?",0,1
"Personally, I think abortion is completely wrong. To actually have conceived to obtain an innocent child and wanting to have an abortion is absolutely sickening. The child is now alive at this point and it is basically murder. How can the law say that if you get in an accident and kill a pregnant woman's child in the process that is murder. So how is abortion not murder. Completely disgusting.",1,1
I really like this subject to the core. I mean they improved the way you can put your pet down and thats just absolutely fantastic. Why make my pet suffer when I can feel proud and safe about having my pet put to rest. I'll always keep this in mind if I ever have to go through some unnecessary events.,0,1
"I think it's absolutely great. Do as you please, its a free world. If people want to be gay I'm all for it. As long as their happy.",0,1
Our government should always continue to open up to new possibilities when it comes to allow people from other countries and coming to live here permanently. If they could provide a better system to allow citizenship it could provide to be the solution to the border problem. I think we should still have a border wall due to the high number of people making it here illegally.,1,1
I can't wait till they legal cannabis all over the United States. I still can't even figure out why they still have it illegal. I guess they don't want americans to indulge in food and snacks. Seriously I am all for cannabis legalization. No doubt in my mind would it lower crime rates and jail occupants.,0,1
"I support it as it reflects the choice of mother (or sometimes both parents). In most cases if the family decides on an abortion, having no alternative would significantly decrease quality of life and financial stance of the family and the baby; baby could be neglected or abandoned and treated without love compared to a baby who is wanted",1,0
"God gave life to a human being, and only God can take it away.",0,1
Gay marriage goes against the basic values of Christianity and defames the institute of marriage and traditional family. It is immoral.,0,1
"I support implementing points-based immigration system similar to Australia or Canada. This country can benefit from highly skilled workers coming from different backgrounds but they have to demonstrate that they would bring value to the country while applying their skills and not becoming a public burden or threat. I oppose policy on asylum-based immigration. While it can help specific individuals to avoid danger at their home country, they have potential to become a public burden in the US",1,1
It should be banned as it can lead to consumption of heavy street drugs; similar to tobacco and alcohol it is addictive,0,0
"I am in favour of abortion in most cases, even the earliest ones. If people do not want children, this is actually one of the safest methods of birth control",1,0
"Euthanasia should be outlawed across-the-board just like abortion. It is killing a living thing, and this is against the principles of the soundest religious teachings.",0,1
"Gay marriage is abnormal, and makes the abnormality of homosexuality even more likely to take over the minds of our children and young adults. It does not result in procreation of natural-born children and homosexuals should not be allowed to adopt children, because the children will often find it too natural.",0,1
"I am of two minds of this issue, because it has become so confusing recently. I think better conditions should be put into place for asylum seekers, and primarily to eliminate those who have real criminal records. Otherwise, I think migrants should be allowed to come to the U.s. in many cases.",1,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized because it often causes deaths from its use. Even more than this, it leads to even stronger and more potentially deadly drugs like heroin and fentanyl. It is used, in fact, only for recreational purposes by those who want it legalized.",0,1
I am pro-choice. I feel an abortion is a personal and private decision for the woman involved. I feel an abortion is best decided by a physician versus a politician. I strongly feel that an abortion is not an easy decision to make and women do not make the decision lightly. I feel hospitals should perform abortions for safety reasons as they would any procedure.,1,1
"It is wrong to kill people period. The 10 commandments command against killing, so any killing is not justified. Euthanasia is a sin and form of suicide will gives you a one way ticket to hell. Euthanasia should come with the death penalty for the person who is helping the person die.",0,1
Gay marriage goes against the values I hold dear as a Christian. It is an abomination to allow gay marriage. Gay marriage erodes away the meaning and sanctity of marriage. Gay marriage is a sin.,0,1
Our country is founded upon immigration. Immigration is what makes our country unique. Migrants should feel welcome in our country. Migrants should attempt to assimilate into our country. Migrants are good people who want a better life.,1,1
We should legalize cannabis like we do with alcohol and cigarettes. Cannabis is no different than having a glass of wine. Cannabis is not addictive. Cannabis does not lead to stronger drug addictions. There are no greater risks with smoking cannabis to your health than having a drink or a cigarette. Everyone smokes cannabis.,0,1
"I am pro-choice but would choose life every time. I think there are instances where abortion is ok, if the baby would have a disease or wouldn't survive outside the womb or in early stages if the woman's life is in jeopardy. But later in pregnancy if the woman's life is in jeopardy then just deliver the baby, don't abort it. Abortion is a permanent situation that will haunt the mother for the rest of her life - she will always remember her lost child and wonder what could have been.",1,1
I am totally against this. Why should people be allowed to decide when they should die? People were made to be here on earth for as long as Gd decides not when they decide. What if it's an impulsive thing and the issue passes but they've already decided to die? There's a permanence that isn't realized in most people who approve this barbaric practice.,0,1
Gay marriage is wrong. Men and women should not marry each other. Their relationships are usually not for life - just for now. Gays are more promiscious and don't believe if life long partners so why allow them to get married and have the same benefits as real married people.,0,1
I think legal migration is ok when people go through the proper chanels to become citizens. The issue when they are illegal is very different and I don't agree with allowing that. Legal migrants do great for the country and really want to be here and show they will be law-abiding and do what they can. They are an asset to the country.,1,1
"Pot should not be legal. It is a drug and any drug is bad for you. It alters your mind and it's worse when you smoke it. Pot causes more lung issues than cigarettes! There's no 'safe' legal limit especially if you're going to drive a car. There's also no field sobriety test or machine to see if you're incapacitated to drive a car. You can't take care of others when you're high, either.",0,1
"I agree that a woman should have the right to choose an abortion. It is her body, and abortion criminalization is an invasion of privacy and an assault on individual rights. However, I am concerned about late-term abortions and believe some limits must be put in place. I also struggle with abortion as an issue because of related issues such as the death penalty. I often find that people who are against abortion are for the death penalty, which seems to be an inconsistent life ethic. If you believe in the sanctity of life, you should be against both abortion and the death penalty.",1,1
"Euthanasia should be allowed. If a person wants to die, who is to say they should not? For example, a person who is very ill and in great pain is suffering more than need be. If they want to die, let them. People who help others die in cases like this should not be penalized.",0,1
"Gay people should not be allowed to marry. It's against natural law and religious doctrine. The reason for marriage is to allow a couple to have children who are not born out of wedlock. Because gay men cannot give birth, marriage is not necessary. And lesbian couples should decide to have a man as a clearly identified parent.",0,1
"I am in favor of letting more migrants into the United States as long as there is a path to legal residency or citizenship. At the same time, I am not opposed to allowing refugees into the country under special provisions. I oppose banning groups from entering the country based on their nationality or religion. In a country with low unemployment and a low birth rate, we need to rely on migration to support the economy.",1,1
"Cannabis should be legalized not just for medical use, but for recreational use as well. Cannabis is no worse than alcohol. So if alcohol sales and use are legal, why not allow cannabis, too? It would reduce reliance on criminal elements in society. Legalized cannabis also could mean increased tax revenue for state and local governments. It's a win-win.",0,1
I believe a woman should choose for herself whether or not to have an abortion. I detest that people think they should be able to control other women based on their own moral or religious perspectives. I do think that abortion is not an ideal solution to the problem of unwanted pregnancy and people should work to ensure that women have access to safe and effective birth control.,1,1
Euthanasia is wrong. Who are we to play God and decide who should live and who should die? It's a slippery slope from allowing assisted suicide for people with terminal illness to allowing euthanasia for people with birth defects or disabilities.,0,1
"I believe that it's unnatural for people of the same sex to marry. God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, and the Bible forbids sexual activity between people of the same sex.",0,1
"We need migrant workers to keep our economy running and to have access to many products. Migrant workers are involved in many aspects of agriculture, and without them we would not have many foods we like, or even the quality of life we are used to.",1,1
"Cannabis should not be legalized because we have enough people in the world who already abuse drugs and alcohol. If we make cannabis legal, there will be people who abuse it and drive under the influence.",0,1
