Task ideas, summarizing what is already written in the notebook (to be updated, based on prof feedback):   
Second approach (compare GPT2 base model and small model vs BERT Base and small model):

1. add a summary describing the datset and the problem (what is written in the paper)
2. do a diagram of how GPT-X works and BERT works
3. Model 1 : GPT2 base model
   
3.1 Model 2 :try with small model (distil-gpt2) 
   
4. Model 3: BERT base model
4.1 Model 4: BERT small model (distil-uncased-bert)
   
5. error analysis  
6. cognitive interpretation
