domain corpus for detecting deception in typed text. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, 1423-1430, (2020, May)



Task ideas, summarizing what is already written in the notebook (to be updated, based on prof feedback):   

1. add a summary describing the dataset and the problem (what is written in the paper)
2. do a diagram of how GPT-3.5 works
3. Model GPT 3.5 - 3 fold cross-validation 3 epoch each NOTE (the cost we spent is for the same fine-tuning structure)
   
   Some useful resources:
   
   a. structure of the code looks good and waits to get the response from OpenAI, so no error:

   b. this tutorial shows the calculations of some KPI
